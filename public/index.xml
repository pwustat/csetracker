      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the application of Machine 
learning (ML) in drug development. ML tools can process information much faster, cheaper 
and more accurately than any human, and some people expect no less than a change to 
the clinical drug development paradigm.&lt;br&gt;
In this seminar, the participants will get up to speed with the opportunities of ML in drug 
development. The statistical details behind the ideas, the implementation using software 
(R) as well as the interpretation of the results will be discussed. Any examples will be 
inspired by real problems.&lt;br&gt;
Markus Lange and Lorenz Uhlmann (both Novartis) will provide an overview of machine 
learning and artificial intelligence and its application in the pharmaceutical industry. They 
will illustrate key elements and principles for building and assessing machine learning 
methods, discuss different types of algorithms (e.g. supervised and unsupervised learning) 
and provide examples of the types of problems where they might be applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials usually involve sequential patient entry. When designing a clinical trial, it is often desirable to include a provision for interim analyses of accumulating data with the potential for stopping the trial early. We review frequentist and Bayesian sequential clinical trial designs with a focus on their fundamental and philosophical differences. Frequentist designs utilize repeated significance testing or conditional power to make early stopping decisions. The majority of frequentist designs are concerned with controlling the overall type I error rate of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis at any analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian designs utilize posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision- making. The prior and threshold values in a Bayesian design can be chosen to either achieve desirable frequentist operating characteristics or reflect the investigator’s subjective belief. We also comment on the likelihood principle, which is commonly tied with statistical inference and decision-making in sequential clinical trials. A single-arm trial example with normally distributed outcomes is used throughout to illustrate some frequentist and Bayesian designs. Numerical studies are conducted to assess these designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will discuss my experiences coordinating two recent clinical trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that used Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs, and present some methodological innovations to improve implementation and understand the potential benefit these designs offer. I will discuss the ACCESS trial (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03119571), which sought to compare the efficacy of two standards or care: direct admission to the cardiac catheter laboratory versus the ICU; and the ARREST trial (NCT03880565), which sought to evaluate the efficacy of in-transit ECMO-facilitated resuscitation versus standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation. My experiences with these trials motivated methodological research into alternative prior choices and randomization techniques that improve type I error control and reduce the risk of enrolling a substantial proportion of participants to an inferior treatment arm. Building upon this research, we proposed and investigated comparing a set of potential designs in terms of the expected number of failures among the cohort most acutely affected by the choice of design; namely, persons who would participate in the trial if it were open to enrollment at the time they become eligible. I plan to discuss the details and take-aways from this line of research&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biostatistics and computational biology are increasingly facing the urgent challenge of efficiently dealing with a large amount of experimental data. In particular, high-throughput assays are transforming the study of biology, as they generate a rich, complex, and diverse collection of high-dimensional data sets. Through compelling statistical analysis, these large data sets lead to discoveries, advances and knowledge that were never accessible before, via compelling statistical analysis. Building such systematic knowledge is a cumulative process which requires analyses that integrate multiple sources, studies, and technologies. The increased availability of ensembles of studies on related clinical populations, technologies, and genomic features poses four categories of important multi-study statistical questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To what extent is biological signal reproducibly shared across different studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can this global signal be extracted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we detect and quantify local signals that may be masked by strong 
global signals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these global and local signals manifest differently in different data types?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will answer these four questions by introducing novel classes of methodologies for the joint analysis of different studies. The goal is to separately identify and estimate 1) common factors reproduced across 
multiple studies, and 2) study-specific factors. We present different medical and biological applications. In all the cases, we clarify the benefits of a joint analysis compared to the standard methods.Our methods could accelerate the pace at which we can combine unsupervised analysis across different studies, and understand the cross-study reproducibility of signal in multivariate data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the durability of protection afforded by Covid-19 vaccines is a public health priority, with the results needed to inform policies around booster vaccinations as well as those around non-pharmaceutical interventions. In this talk, I will present a general framework for estimating the effects of Covid-19 vaccines over time in phase 3 clinical trials and observational studies. I will show some results on the duration of vaccine protection from the Moderna pivotal trial and from the North Carolina statewide surveillance data. The latter data, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, provided rich information about the effectiveness of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines in reducing the risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death over time. I will discuss the implications of these results for booster vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty about optimality of doses of anti-cancer agents approved in recent years, including PD-L1 blockade agents and targeted agents, has led to a movement in the oncology drug development field to reconsider the traditional approach for drug development.  Following in the path of approvals for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, trial designs for dose finding trials have ballooned from sample sizes in the range of 12-50 to the hundreds or more.  In addition, post-marketing trials have demonstrated that lower doses of certain drugs may be as efficacious as approved doses.  The has contributed to a renewed focus on ‘dose optimization,’ causing statisticians, researchers, patient advocates and regulators to realize the profound inadequacies of traditional phase I dose finding designs. Trial approaches need to incorporate the adaptive nature of a seamless toxicity-efficacy paradigm, while maintaining practical aspects of trial implementation, statistical properties, endpoint measurement and safety and well-being of patients. This talk will discuss these aspects and provide recent context of drug approvals in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Closed testing procedures (CTPs) were originally proposed by Marcus, Peritz, and Gabriel (1976). CTPs were developed to provide a multiple testing framework that ensures strong control of the type 1 error rate. Many of the most common methods used when evaluating multiple endpoints in clinical trials (e.g., Holms, Hochberg, Hommel, graphical methods etc.) can be recast as CTPs. In this talk I attempt to make the closure principle more tangible by using a new algebra-based formulation of the closed testing framework. This approach attempts to ensure that each step in the derivations and proofs clearly follows from the previous steps. Through this approach, we build toward a better understanding of the versatility and usefulness of the foundational principle underlying all CTPs. We provide a framework for understanding how the closure principle controls the type 1 error rate and what we believe to be an accessible proof of how the closure principle strongly controls the family-wise error rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classical-textbook-inference assumes that a model that is used for inference is correct and given before the analysis. Statistical practice, however, includes variable selection and model selection steps before arriving at the inference part. When confidence intervals or hypothesis tests are to be constructed for parameters in a selected model, most likely misspecified, the classical formulas no longer apply in the sense that computed p-values via classical formulas are smaller than they actually are and confidence intervals are too narrow for the intended nominal coverage. The main starting point of selective inference is to condition on the event of having selected the model that one wishes to use for inference. As a tool for valid inference in this talk confidence distributions are used, conditional on the event of having selected a model. Under some assumptions, uniformly most powerful post-selection confidence curves are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;A two-day webinar hosted on Feb 1st and 3rd, 5 - 7 am PST, by International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar aims to discuss recent developments in robust estimation in linear time series models, with short and long memory correlation structures, in the presence of additive outliers.  Robust estimators of the auto covariance matrix will be discussed from both time and domain approaches from both theoretical and applied points of view. A variety of application models will be considered for the use of the proposed methodologies, such as multivariate techniques (factor analysis and PCA), time series and mixed models. Real applications will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Limited access to large-scale, high-quality, and multi-source data is one of the key obstacles to deploying modern machine learning models, which is partly due to the reluctance of information exchange out of privacy concerns. Recent studies have found that data privacy has the potential to grow into a gigantic industry, because of the increasing demand of data sharing, fast development of AI software and platforms, and the vast adoption of data-related regulations and policies. In this talk, we will provide a broad overview regarding the status quo of data privacy, and render more details in differential privacy, one of the state-of-the-art data protection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tipping point sensitivity analysis for time-to-event: a case study in belimumab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will illustrate one way of implementing a tipping point analysis (TPA) for a time-to-event endpoint to assess the robustness of results to the censoring-at-random assumption. The method is based on multiple imputation and it assumes the hazard rate post-censoring changes. A grid of values reflecting such changes is considered to vary the hazard rate post-censoring independently for each treatment arm. The (experimental, control) pairs of post-censoring hazard rate changes form the TPA scenarios. Within each of the TPA scenarios, participants who are censored are imputed a time to the event of interest and are administratively censored if the imputed time exceeds the length of the follow-up. Results are combined across imputed datasets using Rubin’s rules. Finally, the plausibility of the scenarios where the results tip is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Practical use of Tipping Point Analysis in regulatory submissions of clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tipping point analysis (TPA) approach has gained popularity recently as an approach for performing the sensitivity analysis under the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption. This presentation will review why TPA gets popular in clinical trial submissions, its implementation for binary endpoints for time-independent imputation and time-dependent imputation, general procedure of TPA implementation for continuous endpoints, and Interpretation of TPA result based on clinical input. The presentation then shows six real examples of FDA statistical review of submitted NDA/BLAs (all in public domain) that use TPA as sensitivity analysis to illustrate the practical use of this method in real trials and important consideration points from the regulatory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in biomedical research, scRNA-seq datasets with multiple patient samples become common. In this talk, I will introduce our recent research on analyzing multi-sample scRNA-seq data. I will introduce TreeCorTreat, an open source R package that uses a tree-based correlation screen to help explore and visualize the association between samples’ phenotype and their transcriptomic features at multiple cell type resolutions. I will also introduce Lamian, a statistical framework for differential pseudotime analysis with multiple samples. I will demonstrate these tools using both simulation and real data including an integrative analysis of COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20211210survival-analysis-based-on-the-restricted-mean-survival-time-an-alternative-to-the-proportional-hazards-model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Professor Sir David Cox proposed the hazard ratio (HR) and its inference procedure in 1972, the HR has been routinely used for quantifying the treatment effect on time to event endpoint. The Cox regression model has also been commonly used for the association and prediction analysis. While an ideal summary measure for the treatment effect should be model-free to avoid the model misspecification at the analysis, the HR is not such a measure.  Indeed, there are very few model-free measures for time to event endpoint. The most popular one is either based on the median failure time or the event rate at a specific time point. Both measures are “local” and cannot catch the short- or long-term survival profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, issues of utilizing HR have been extensively discussed. The validity of the HR estimate depends on a strong model assumption; that is, the ratio of two hazard functions is constant over time. When the proportion hazards assumption is not met, the HR estimate is difficult, if not impossible to interpret. In fact, the parameter for which the empirical HR estimates is not a simple weighted average of the HR over time and it generally depends on the censoring distributions. This is highly undesirable. Moreover, even when the proportional hazards assumption is plausible, the physical/clinical interpretation of a single ratio such as the HR estimate between two groups cannot be easily translated into the clinical utility of a new treatment in the absence of a reference hazard level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short course, Tian will illustrate issues of the HR and present an alternative, that is, the t-year mean survival time (restricted mean survival time, RMST). It is the mean event-free time up to a specific time point, say, t-year. The RMST was introduced in the statistical literature in 1949, but has not gotten much attention until recently. Here is the list of the topics we will discuss in this short course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues of Hazard Ratio (HR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted mean survival time (RMST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power comparison between RMST-based test and HR-based tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empirical choice of a truncation time for RMST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study design based on RMST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST for stratified analysis of survival data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST to non-inferiority trials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST to quantify long-term survival benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST to assess duration of response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST in the presence of competing risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMST for recurrent event time data&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Count data plays an important role in biomedical and clinical research, especially nowadays with the rapid biomedical technique progresses including next generation sequencing. However, using routine statistical model to analyze counts, such as Poisson model, often results in biased or even misleading conclusions. Primary challenges when applying Poisson model to count data include over-dispersion and zero-inflation, which are commonly encountered in practice. In addition, the repeated measures and incomplete observations in modern clinical trials and survey studies add to complexity. This talk will review these challenges in count data analysis and recent methodology progresses made by the speaker&amp;rsquo;s group. In addition, the application of counting process method to the cutting-edge single-molecule localization microscopy image analysis and recently developed innovative statistical methods will also be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine Conference</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20211208diagnostics-and-personalized-medicine-conference/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20211208diagnostics-and-personalized-medicine-conference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diagnostics are important for the detection and prevention of disease, determination of treatment effectiveness, and improvement in overall health outcomes. As diagnostics can be used to develop an individualized treatment plan or predict a toxicity associated with a particular therapeutic, they are intimately associated with the field of personalized medicine. The ability to enhance patient care using personalized medicines has prompted pharmaceutical companies to increase their interest in the targeted therapy space. In fact, over the past 6 years, personalized medicines have represented more than 20 percent of FDA’s newly approved therapeutic molecular entities. Additionally, the diagnostic landscape is changing, with the advent of novel technologies and sequencing methods, and an increased focus on the role of software and novel algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development accelerates, we can expect a growing need for clarity regarding regulatory submissions. For example, the co-development of a companion diagnostic to identify patients that will benefit from a new innovative treatment may present a regulatory challenge for companies wanting to bring them to market simultaneously via an accelerated approval pathway. Also, the need for rapid development of reliable diagnostics may cause companies to continually turn to regulators about the data necessary for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the NEW 2021 DIA Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine Conference, we will have an open dialogue about the challenges and trends in the development of diagnostics and personalized medicines today. Attendees will receive industry and regulatory perspectives on pathways for approval in the US and globally, the impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes, overcoming challenges in development, lessons learned from the COVID-19 diagnostic experience, and utilizing the patient voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monte Carlo algorithms have completely revolutionised statistical computation, allowing previously intractable models to be solved easily. In particular, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have facilitated the application of Bayesian inference in a multitude of settings. One reason for their success is their strong theoretical foundations, which allow us to validate the basic algorithms, provide numerous extensions and generalisations, clarify different options and tunings, and evaluate the results. This talk will present some simple dynamic graphical examples to illustrate the workings of MCMC. It will emphasise the impact and importance of various theoretical MCMC issues including ergodicity, qualitative and quantitative convergence rates, optimal scalings, and adaptive MCMC. It will not assume any previous MCMC background, and is designed to be accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The current pandemic has emphasised the key role that statistics play in understanding what is going on around us.  But how reliable are all these numbers?  How much should we trust what we hear and read?  When do statistics become misinformation?  I will look at the way that statistics can be used to try and persuade audiences to think or act in a certain way, including some utter data disasters, and contrast this with efforts to make communication &amp;lsquo;trustworthy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Statistical Methods for Indirect Comparison with RWD Studies with Survival Endpoint under Non-proportional Hazards</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The time-to-event endpoint is an important data type used in real-world data (RWD) studies. The non-proportional hazards (NPH) patterns and the confounding bias induced by lacking randomization are two main obstacles when dealing with time-to-event outcomes in RWD studies. Previous methods have been proposed to adjust for
either NPH patterns or confounding bias, but no previous work has discussed the simultaneous adjustments for both of them. We proposed a propensity score stratified Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model, which incorporates the propensity score stratification adjustment into the Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model. The proposed method could adjust for both observed confounding bias and NPH patterns, and it is easy to implement and has robust performance in the simulation setting
under different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, our goal is to review different types of Bayesian and frequentist designs that may be used for expansion cohorts in phase 1 trials and in single-arm and randomized phase 2 trials in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– We will start by reviewing the recent evolution and general trends in the design of early-phase trials to investigate the activity of targeted agents and immunotherapy.&lt;br&gt;
– We will then summarize the most salient features of Bayesian and frequentist designs in this setting.&lt;br&gt;
– Finally, we will cover different statistical caveats, including early consideration of randomization, issues related to sample-size calculation and the efficient use of biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Building on the previous webinar series we will present a refresher on the key elements of the estimand framework and use the ETHOS study to illustrate the estimand framework and to highlight the different options that may be of interest to different stakeholders. The background and disease context of the case will be described, the important events (termed intercurrent events) occurring in the trial will be described and three estimands will be showcased. It will then be explored how best to communicate the estimands in medical journals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENAR members: free; IBS members: $65; Non-members: $85&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICH E9(R1) Addendum on &amp;lsquo;Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials&amp;rsquo; introduced a framework to align planning, design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. When defining the clinical question of interest, clarity is needed about &amp;lsquo;intercurrent events&amp;rsquo; that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest, such as discontinuation of assigned treatment, use of an additional or alternative treatment and terminal events such as death. The description of an estimand should reflect the clinical question of interest in respect of these intercurrent events, and the Addendum introduces strategies to reflect different questions of interest that might be posed. The choice of strategies can influence how more conventional attributes of a trial are reflected when describing the clinical question, for example the treatments, population or the variable (endpoint) of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this seminar we briefly introduce the estimand framework according to the ICH E9(R1) Addendum and describe various strategies for addressing intercurrent events when defining the clinical question of interest. We then reflect on the experience and lessons learned of implementing the Addendum through an internal cross-functional and cross-divisional working group that encompasses various estimand initiatives. Next, we discuss in detail the hypothetical estimand strategy, where a scenario is envisaged in which the intercurrent event would not occur. The Addendum acknowledges that a wide variety of hypothetical scenarios can be envisaged, but it also clarifies that some scenarios are likely to be of more clinical or regulatory interest than others. We share our experiences and try to provide some guidance on their use in clinical trial practice. Finally, we demonstrate how the estimand framework can usefully be applied to clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to address potential pandemic-related trial disruptions and embed them in the context of study objectives and design elements. We introduce different hypothetical estimand strategies and review various causal inference and missing data methods such as multiple imputation and (augmented) inverse probability weighting for the estimation step. To clarify, we describe the features of a stylized trial in neuroscience, and how it may have been impacted by the pandemic. This stylized trial will then be re-visited by discussing the changes to the estimand and the estimator to account for pandemic disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently the UK Biobank study has conducted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of over 40,000 participants. In addition, publicly available imaging genetic datasets also emerge from several other independent studies. We collected massive individual-level MRI data from different data resources, harmonized image processing procedures, and conducted the largest genetic studies so far for various neuroimaging traits from different structural and functional modalities. In this talk, we showcase novel clinical findings from our analyses, such as the shared genetic influences among brain structures, functions, and the genetic overlaps with a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes. We also discuss challenges we have faced when analyzing these biobank-scale datasets and highlight opportunities for future research. This presentation is based on a series of works with members in the BIG-S2 lab of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Our results can be easily browsed through the Brain Imaging Genetics Knowledge Portal (BIGKP) (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bigkp.org/&#34;&gt;https://bigkp.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PSI Sub Group SIG Webinar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar we look at some recent advances in statistical methods for identifying treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. This ranges from identifying baseline biomarkers likely to influence the treatment effect (ranking) to provide novel biomarker &amp;lsquo;signatures&amp;rsquo; (subgroups) with associated estimated enhanced effect (Individual Treatment Effects). Some practical issues ranges from overfitting risks, biases, and confounding of prognostic and predictive effects. Modern methods aim to overcome such potential difficulties while remaining flexible, and offer a structured approach to the problem (aiming to avoid the notorious &amp;lsquo;data dredging&amp;rsquo;). The novel techniques are often tree based and/or penalized regression, i.e., with a machine learning flavour. Sometimes the aim of the analysis is to predict the individual optimal treatment allocation given baseline biomarker data (Individual Treatment Rules). Efficient Visualization of relationships in the data is also of importance in the practical applications. The talks will highlight and discuss such aspects and will also reflect typical aspects discussed within the EFSPI/PSI Subgroup Special Interest Group. (While this event is not intended as a formal course, it will still serve as an introduction and overview to the area, as well as covering some more technically challenging material for the more experienced participant).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People pursuing data science careers default for Tech companies without considering the more classic industries like agriculture, manufacturing, supply chain, etc. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my personal journey transitioning from Tech into AgTech and highlight the challenges many data scientists face who do this transition. I&amp;rsquo;ll close with why data science in these classic industries may be more appealing than opportunities in Tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Adaptive subgroup enrichment design is an efficient design framework that allows accelerated development for investigational treatments while also having flexibility in population selection within the course of the trial. The adaptive decision at the interim analysis is commonly made based on the conditional probability of trial success. However, one of the critical challenges for such adaptive designs is immature data for interim decisions, particularly in the targeted subgroup with a limited sample size at the first stage of the trial. In this paper, we improve the interim decision making by incorporating information from surrogate endpoints when estimating conditional power at the interim analysis, by predicting the primary treatment effect based on the observed surrogate endpoint and prior knowledge or historical data about the relationship between endpoints. Modified conditional power is developed for both selecting the patient population to be enrolled after the interim analysis and sample size re-estimation. In the simulation study, our proposed design shows a higher chance to make desirable interim decisions and achieves higher overall power, while controlling the overall type I error. This performance is robust over drift of prior knowledge from the true relationship between two endpoints. We also demonstrate the application of our proposed design in two case studies in oncology and vaccine trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Matrix completion is a modern missing data problem where the object of interest is a highdimensional and often low-rank matrix. In this talk, I will discuss the application of weighting methods to deal with non-uniform missingness in matrix completion problems. I will highlight some unique challenges associated with inverse probability weighting (IPW)—a standard weighting approach—under matrix completion settings. Then I will introduce our most recent work on matrix completion under general non-uniform missing structures. We draw insight from covariate-balancing methods developed for treatment effect estimations and break away from the IPW framework. By controlling an upper bound of a novel balancing error, we construct weights that can actively adjust for the non-uniformity in the empirical risk without explicitly modeling the observation probabilities. The recovered matrix based on the proposed weighted empirical risk enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. In particular, the proposed method achieves a stronger guarantee than existing work in terms of the scaling with respect to the observation probabilities, under asymptotically heterogeneous missing settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that stimulates a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. It demonstrates characteristics distinct from conventional chemotherapy and stands to revolutionize cancer treatment. We propose a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design that incorporates the unique features of immunotherapy by simultaneously considering three outcomes: immune response, toxicity and efficacy. The objective is to identify the biologically optimal dose, defined as the dose with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. An Emax model is utilized to describe the marginal distribution of the immune response. Conditional on the immune response, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a latent variable approach. Using the accumulating data, we adaptively randomize patients to experimental doses based on the continuously updated model estimates. A simulation study shows that our proposed design has good operating characteristics in terms of selecting the target dose and allocating patients to the target dose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Although individually randomised trials are the gold standard for assessing the impact of new treatments on the outcomes of individuals, they aren’t always possible. In many situations, including when treatments are applied at the group (or “cluster”) level, cluster randomised trials must instead be conducted. Such designs are less efficient than individually randomised trials: larger numbers of participants are required than for equivalent individually randomised trials. Longitudinal cluster randomised trials can claw back some lost efficiency, by instructing clusters to switch between treatments during the trial. Stepped wedge trials are a particular type of longitudinal cluster randomised trial design that has seen a rapid rise in popularity in recent years. In this talk I’ll discuss work investigating the statistical aspects of stepped wedge trials that points the way towards less burdensome and more efficient “incomplete” variants. This work highlights the fact that in stepped wedge designs, not all observations are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s well-known that clinical trials are one of the most expensive parts of the drug development process. Addressable bottlenecks include improving access to knowledge for protocol design such as site selection, assessment schedules, eligibility criteria, and more. As well as clinical trial design, data extraction from clinical literature is also useful for other applications such as competitive intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such extraction, usually done manually, is often tedious and error-prone. Linguamatics NLP is a valuable technology for extracting and synthesizing the high value information that is found in unstructured text. In this webinar, we will discuss the benefits of text analytics and natural language processing over internal and external clinical trial data to optimize clinical trial design and gain knowledge from legacy data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coron-aVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread to over 200 countries across all habitable continents, resulting in hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths.  Although significant progress has been made on understanding the genetic and genomic underpinning of the disease and developing therapeutics and vaccines, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Examples includes the emergence of virus variants, how they spread, how the immune system responds, the impact of new variants on vaccines, the roles of host genetics and physiology on determining the disease infection and clinical course of the disease progression, and the long-term effects of the disease. The 2021 PQG conference will focus on the quantitative methods and experimental strategies to address these critical challenges in COVID-19 genomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the conference will be centered on the following three topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SESSION I: Viral Genomics and Phylogenetics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SESSION II: SarsCov2 and the Host&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall survival or progression-free survival are considered gold standard primary endpoints in Phase III cancer trials but their use in earlier trials has been limited due to the long follow-up time required in most diseases. Instead response to treatment, defined as a certain amount of shrinkage in the sum of tumor sizes, is commonly used in Phase Ib and II settings. Despite this common use, definition of response is very challenging, in particular dealing with multiple lesions, determining the cutoff in shrinkage, the time of response assessment, dealing with new lesions and measurement error due to reader-to-reader variability. The correlation with clinical outcomes and survival is not always as strong as one would expect for a myriad of these reasons. We will present our joint work in this field with a history of 20 years, pointing out to improvements in the field as well as the remaining challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The 2-in-1 adaptive design allows seamless expansion of an ongoing Phase 2 trial into a Phase 3 trial to expedite a drug development program. Under a mild assumption that is expected to generally hold in practice, the trial can be tested at the full alpha level with or without expansion. The endpoint used for expansion decision can be the same as or different from the primary endpoints, and there is no restriction on the expansion bar. Due to its flexibility and robustness, it has drawn immediate attention to academic researchers and industry practitioners. The design has been substantially extended in the literature and successfully implemented in multiple trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will discuss about decision on the expansion bar as well as various extensions of the 2-in-1 design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A live Q&amp;amp;A and networking will follow after the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In life-threatening/rare diseases, randomized controlled trial often runs into feasibility and even ethical issue. Single-arm interventional trial with historical control (HC) as the comparator, highlighted in the recent FDA Real World Evidence (RWE) framework, provides an alternative approach to assess the effectiveness of the investigative therapy in these challenging scenarios. A roadmap of using HC in clinical trials by DIA NEED team will be introduced and then followed by the discussions on statistical methodologies commonly used with HC. In the end, a few selected NDA/BLA filing cases, where HC was used as the comparator in the pivotal trials, will be presented, providing some practical guidance on incorporating historical data from the stage of trial design to the stage of data analysis. Our main findings and recommendation are published at Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Possible Hazards of Proportional Hazards Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASA North Carolina Chapter Webinar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cox proportional hazard (PH) model is widely used to determine the effects of risk factors and treatments on survival time of subjects that might be right censored. The selection of covariates may depend crucially on the specific form of the chosen conditional hazard model, which is often assumed to be PH, accelerated failure time (AFT), or proportional odds (PO). However, through empirical and theoretical
examples show that none of these semiparametric models allow for the crossing of the survival functions and hence such strong assumptions may adversely affect the selection of variables. Moreover, the most commonly
used PH assumption may also be violated when there is a delayed effect of the risk factors. A sequence of Bernstein polynomials based model is instead presented which provides (i) a smooth estimator of the conditional hazard function and is shown to be a unique solution of a strictly convex optimization problem; making it computationally attractive, (ii) a model that encompasses PH structure, and (iii) large sample properties including consistency and convergence rates established under a set of mild regularity conditions. Empirical results based on several simulated data scenarios indicate that the superior performances of the model and thereby shown to avoid possible hazards of the proportional hazard like assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSI Training Course: Repeated Measured and Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20211014psi-training-course-repeated-measured-and-mixed-models/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20211014psi-training-course-repeated-measured-and-mixed-models/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated measures of patients through time and other clustered data are common in randomised clinical trials and associated observational studies. Measurements taken from the same patient (or from the same cluster) are likely to be correlated, so that the assumption that all responses will be identically distributed and independent from each other will not hold. Ignoring within-cluster correlation will result in bias in the estimate of the treatment effect standard error and therefore, incorrect confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In some situations it can also result in bias in the treatment estimate itself. Using a range of worked examples, this course will explain how to analyse repeated measures and other clustered data, with an emphasis on estimating treatment effects using the appropriate covariance structure between measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is presented through recorded lectures and online practical sessions using SAS code. It is suitable for statisticians working on clinical trials, who already have a good understanding of linear and generalised linear models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;br&gt;
• Conditional models for continuous hierarchical data&lt;br&gt;
• Conditional models for continuous longitudinal data&lt;br&gt;
• Marginal models (GEE) for continuous longitudinal data&lt;br&gt;
• Discrete data&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are experiments performed on human volunteers to evaluate a candidate intervention to a control. Randomizing participants to an intervention arm is the gold standard to causally assess the benefit-to-risk ratio.  While clinical trials require appropriate design considerations and pre-specification of analytic methods, interim monitoring of study recruitment, retention, safety, and efficacy are essential to preserve trial integrity.  To this end, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC, also referred to as a Data Safety Monitoring Board/Committee, DSMB/DSMC) typically comprised of 3-5 experts, including clinicians and a (bio)statistician, serves to safeguard trial participants, assess benefit-to-risk, and provide recommendations to the sponsor (e.g., pharmaceutical company or government institution) based on accumulating trial data.  Statisticians play critical roles on the DMC, the sponsor&amp;rsquo;s study team, and as an independent statistician (receives and summarizes unblinded data for DMC review).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is the industry-standard platform for version control, and GitHub is the online platform for managing git projects. I will give a broad overview of the git application and GitHub platform, with specific applications illustrated with Rstudio. Following the book, &amp;ldquo;Happy git with R&amp;rdquo; by Jenny Bryan, I will show how to set up a GitHub account and connect it to Rstudio, create Rstudio projects that use git for version checking, and manage these projects using GitHub. I will demonstrate key verbs in the git language, including adding files to be committed, committing changes to files, and pushing changes into GitHub. I will also show elementary examples of collaboration with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning Algorithms provide an attractive suite of online learning methods for personalizing interventions in Digital Health. However after a reinforcement learning algorithm has been run in a clinical study, how do we assess whether personalization occurred? We might find users for whom it appears that the algorithm has indeed learned in which contexts the user is more responsive to a particular intervention.  But could this have happened completely by chance? We discuss some first approaches to addressing these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are the gold standard for approvals by regulatory agencies. However, RCT&amp;rsquo;s are increasingly time consuming, expensive, and laborious with a multitude of bottlenecks involving volunteer recruitment, patient truancy, and adverse events. An alternative that fast tracks clinical trials without compromising quality of scientific results is desirable to more rapidly bring therapies to consumers. We propose a model-based approach using nonparametric Bayesian common atoms models for patient baseline covariates. This specific class of models has two critical advantages in this context: (i) The models have full prior support, i.e., allow to approximate arbitrary distributions without unreasonable restrictions or shrinkage in specific parametric families; (ii) inference naturally facilitates a reweighting scheme to achieve equivalent populations. We prove equivalence of the synthetic and other patient cohorts using an independent separate verification. Failure to classify a merged data set using a flexible statistical learning method such as random forests, support vector machines etc. proves equivalence. We implement the proposed approach in two motivating case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Covariate balance is one of the most important concerns for successful comparative
studies (about causal effects), such as causal inference, online A/B testing and clinical
trials. However, chance imbalance may still exist in traditional randomized experiments,
and are substantial increasing in big data. In this talk, we discuss several new adaptive
designs and their advantages. The proposed methods show substantial advantages over
the traditional methods in terms of the covariate balance and computational time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the randomization inevitably uses the covariate information when forming balanced
treatment assignments, the validity of classical statistical inference following such
randomization is often unclear in literature. We derived the theoretical properties of
statistical inference post general covariate-adjusted randomization under the linear model
framework. More important, we explicitly unveil the relationship between covariateadjusted designs and inference properties. We apply the proposed general theory to
commonly used procedures and compare their performance analytically. These results
open a new door to understand and analyze comparative studies based on covariateadjusted randomization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;ACTIV-2 is a major international platform trial led by the NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials  Group.  It was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has evaluated several candidate agents for the treatment of non-hospitalized people with symptomatic COVID-19, with the aim of reducing hospitalizations and deaths.  The design incorporates novel design features including the sharing of placebo control groups, potentially with different placebos for each candidate agent, and a seamless transition from phase 2 to phase 3 evaluation.  I will discuss the design and implementation of this complex trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every pharmaceutical company collects, analyzes, and reports safety data collected in trials and in the general use on their products to fulfill regulations and detect new signals to keep their product labels up to date. While those actions have an indirect benefit for the patient, to truly help them and their healthcare practitioners it is necessary to go beyond the raw data and translate the information into the benefit to risk context, informing risk management plans and specific mitigation actions that are derived from data. The goal of pharmacovigilance should be to minimize pain and suffering in patients who strive to benefit from the medicine prescribed by their physician. By properly characterizing benefits and risks of medicines in appropriate populations and semi-quantitatively or quantitatively estimating whether and to which extent the benefits outweigh the risks one can create tangible context for regulators, prescribers, and patients. This informs specific action plans for the health care provider to optimize the use of the treatment ensuring the right medicine gets to right patient. We will present our experience on some specific examples derived directly from our joint experience in safety and pharmacovigilance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific communities are in great need to develop innovative trial designs that can incorporate multiple treatments and/or multiple diseases. Such designs provide results for multiple complex hypotheses of clinical interest and reduce the cost and timeline of development. There has been increasing interest in adopting master protocols to expedite clinical development programs. Master protocol have the potential to drive tremendous efficiencies in the development of new therapeutics or vaccines. These trials, in general, are more efficient and less costly than to perform trials individually. These efficiencies can be operational and/or statistical in nature. The master protocol is defined as one overarching protocol that would answer multiple questions or hypotheses. It includes a wide variety of designs with one potential treatment and different disease/population (basket design), multiple potential treatment and one disease (umbrella design), and multiple potential treatment along with multiple disease/population (platform design). In addition, master protocols are adaptive to include early stopping for efficacy or futility, sample size adjustment, dropping an arm, changing randomization ratio, and introducing a new treatment arm during trial. Further statistical efficiency can be gained by use of a shared control. In rare or difficult to enroll populations, a master protocol offers the opportunity to steer important new therapies into a standing clinical trials infrastructure, potentially expediting the availability of badly needed new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short course will provide an overview of the master protocol along with statistical and operational aspects. This will cover methodology, general design framework and strategies, sample size calculation, and necessary steps for protocol implementation. In addition, we will share through case studies on practical points to consider when running master protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASA Traveling Course (Hosted by Connecticut Chapter): Guidelines for using State-of-the-Art Methods to Estimate Propensity Score and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights When Drawing Causal Inferences </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The estimation of causal effects is one of the primary activities of most longitudinal research studies. For example, analysts might want to understand whether a particular substance abuse treatment program is effective for its clients, whether school-based substance prevention actually reduces substance use, whether interventions can improve the quality and efficiency of mental health care, or whether incentives can increase military recruiting or the retention of service members. Controlled experiments are held as the gold standard for estimating such effects. However, experiments are often infeasible for many reasons and only observational data, in which participation in a program or intervention is out of the control of the researchers, are available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short course will provide an introduction to causal modeling using the potential outcomes framework and use of propensity score weights in the estimation of causal effects from observational data. The course will also provide step-by-step guidelines on how to estimate and perform diagnostic checks of propensity score weights for evaluations examining the relative effectiveness of two interventions. The course will also discuss methods for assessing the sensitivity of finding to unobserved covariates. Attendees will gain hands on experience estimating propensity score weights, evaluating the quality of those weights, and utilizing the weights for estimating intervention effects. The course can provide demonstrations of available software in R, SAS, Stata and Shiny (as needed) for fitting the models and opportunities for conducting analyses. The primary goals of the course are for attendees to have an understanding of how to implement propensity score weighting using state-of-art-methods and insights into some of the practical issues that evaluating the quality of propensity score weights involve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immuno-oncology (I-O) and cell therapy, the frontier of cancer treatment, is a rapidly developing area that brings new opportunities to patients. It is critical to identify optimal dose and patient populations in early phase of trials thus improving the probability of success in pivotal trials. Given the complex mechanism interacting with immune system and patient heterogeneity, the conventional oncology dose finding design may not serve the purpose. For example, it is questionable to believe the monotone relationship between dose level and safety/efficacy, which will likely result in inappropriate dose selection using designs with monotone assumption. Additionally, considering the immune system pathway, designs ignoring the heterogeneity of the patient populations may provide misleading dose decisions, which could be either unsafe or lead to selection mistakes for targeted population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar will provide a review and discussion of innovative designs for optimal dose determination in I-O and Cell Therapy from the following perspectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding focusing on DLT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding considering late onset toxicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding in basket trials with borrowing scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal dose identification design incorporating both safety and efficacy endpoints&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has accomplished unprecedented performance accuracies in settings with big data and large computational resources. In this talk, we explore whether deep learning can be successful in smaller-scale settings, even those where the number of variables far exceeds the number of observations. We show that adding a sparse group lasso penalty to the training loss induces variable selection and drastically improves prediction accuracy. We then introduce skip-connections, which allow us to perform variable selection and architecture search simultaneously. The resulting training procedure only requires tuning two hyper-parameters, making deep learning practical even in settings with limited data or computational resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk describes a roadmap on three key problems in pancreatic cancer imaging solution: early screening, precision differential diagnosis, and deep prognosis on patient survival prediction. (1) Based on a new self-learning framework, we train the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) segmentation model using a larger quantity of patients (≈1,000, four institutions), with a mix of annotated/unannotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated by combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on unannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model that identifies associated vessels around the pancreas. Our approach makes it technically feasible for robust large-scale PDAC screening from multi-institutional multi-phase partially-annotated CT scans. (2) We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask. Our results are comparable to a multimodality clinical test that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients with cysts. (3) Accurate preoperative prognosis of resectable PDACs for personalized treatment is highly desired in clinical practice. We present a novel deep neural network for the survival prediction of resectable PDAC patients, 3D Contrast-Enhanced Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CE-ConvLSTM), to derive the tumor attenuation signatures from CE-CT imaging studies. Our framework can significantly improve the prediction performances upon existing state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. This deep tumor signature has evidently added values (as a predictive biomarker) to be combined with the existing clinical staging system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a clinically beneficial and safe dose (or doses) is one of the most difficult and consequential decisions in the drug development process.  Dose justification often relies on dose-response modeling, but parametric assumptions must be made a priori, often with little information, potentially leading to a situation where the chosen model does not fit the data well.  This is particularly problematic in longitudinal dose-response models, where additional parametric assumptions must be made on the longitudinal trajectory of each dose.  This presentation proposes a class of longitudinal dose-response models to be used in the Bayesian model averaging paradigm which can improve trial operating characteristics while maintaining flexibility a priori.  The benefits and trade-offs of the proposed method are demonstrated through a simulation study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss the data requirements and the data source to be used in the pilot investigation with the focus on how to assess if the data is sufficient for the purposes of trial emulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webinar 3: Study Design Considerations and an update on the pilot investigation in Cancer &lt;a href=&#34;https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3335449/851418F9D50BAE89FDF5831BAB74490A?mode=login&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Replay Link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an overview of challenges posed by the design of the ongoing pilot project in which we are leveraging real-world data to explicitly emulate a target trial comparing the efficacy of three different systemic therapies used to treat pancreatic cancer.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>A Bayesian phase I/II platform design for co-developing drug combination therapies for multiple indications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly common to combine a new targeted or immunotherapy agent with the cancer-specific standard of care to treat different types of cancers. We propose a master-protocol-based, Bayesian phase I/II platform design to co-develop combination (BPCC) therapies in multiple cancers. Under the BPCC design, only a single master protocol is needed, and the drug is evaluated in different cancers in a concurrent or staggered fashion. For each cancer, we jointly model dose-toxicity and -efficacy relationships and employ Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across them for more efficient cancer-specific decision making. To account for the characteristic of targeted or immunotherapy agents that their efficacy may not monotonically increase with the dose, and often plateau at high doses, we use the utility to quantify the risk-benefit tradeoff of the treatment. At each interim, we update the toxicity and efficacy model, as well as the estimate of the utility, based on the observed data across cancers to inform the cancer-specific decision of dose escalation and de-escalation and identify the optimal biological dose for each cancer. Simulation study shows that the BPCC design has desirable operating characteristics, and that it provides an efficient approach to accelerate the development of combination therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nitin will show that Pareto Optimality, a simple and intuitive concept for partial ordering, is very effective in sifting through results of a large number of trial design simulations to identify a set of designs that collectively dominate all other designs for the three criteria of power, cost and duration in an oncology Ph3 trial design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more clinical trials have started adopting the estimand framework in protocols after the release of the ICH E9(R1) &amp;ldquo;Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials&amp;rdquo;.  However, there is currently still a lack of clarity on the role of hypothetical strategies. The addendum recognizes that &amp;ldquo;when using the hypothetical strategy, some conditions are likely to be more acceptable for regulatory decision making than others&amp;rdquo;. However, it is still unclear as to what constitutes &amp;ldquo;acceptable hypothetical conditions&amp;rdquo; which could lead to an interpretable treatment effect.  Therefore, it is of great interest to have a diverse group of experts take a deep dive into this topic and help shed light on considerations of hypothetical strategies relevant to the clinical question of interest.  In this webinar, we will have speakers from regulatory agencies and industry to share their perspectives on this interesting topic and also participate in a panel-discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the rapid increase in the volume, variety, and accessibility of digitized RWD and RWE has presented unprecedented opportunities for the use of RWD and RWE throughout the drug product lifecycle. We believe RWD and RWE will be leading the statistical innovation in healthcare industry and regulatory decision making for the next decades. In clinical development, RWD and RWE have the potential to improve the planning and execution of clinical trials and create a virtual control arm for a single arm for accelerated approval and label expansion. From the product lifecycle perspective, effective insights gleaned from RWE bring about informative relative benefits of drugs, comparative effectiveness, price optimization, and new indications.  Aiming to present a wide range of RWE applications throughout the lifecycle of drug product development, we have written a book &amp;ldquo;Real-World Evidence in Drug Development and Evaluation&amp;rdquo; which was published in February 2021. At the 2021 Boston Pharma Symposium, we are excited to share with researchers Chapter 4 – External Control Using RWE and Historical Data in Clinical Development. This seminar will discuss the recent case studies that adopted RWD and RWE in the clinical development and evaluation from the following perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize synthetic control to support single arm study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize natural history study for rare disease development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize RWD/historical data for label expansion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical considerations of using RWD/historical data in the clinical development&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Constraint Promising Zone (CPZ) design, a new innovation on the promising zone design. The CPZ is a design that is easy to implement, and easy for all stakeholders to understand and accept. It is based on the intuitively plausible notion that any additional investment of sample size at an interim analysis should be contingent on a minimal acceptable return on the investment, expressed in terms of guaranteed conditional power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laboratory data is critical to patient safety and essential for a wide variety of uses from public health surveillance to research.  Despite the fact that laboratory data has been digitalized for decades, aggregation is difficult because of problems with semantic interoperability. SHIELD (Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Lab Data) is a public-private partner with over 70 partners devoted to establishing a national system for “describing the same test the same way, every time.”  Gregory will set out current barriers to laboratory interoperability and the SHIELD Strategic Planning Effort that is currently underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The estimands framework, introduced in the ICH E9 (R1) guideline, facilitates discussions during design of clinical trials to ensure alignment between the key scientific question of interest, analysis and interpretation. In the context of oncology solid tumor randomized studies, commonly performed analyses of progression-free survival (PFS) will be reviewed, with a critical eye on which question they address, using the estimands terminology. The estimands framework will not necessarily change common analysis methods within oncology, but will describe in detail how intercurrent events (such as subsequent therapy) will be taken into account and increase transparency on the treatment effect being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has been rapid growth in the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse the vast amounts of data being generated in all areas of society. ML and AI approaches are increasingly being employed in health research, and sometimes are even explicitly called for by funders. While ML and AI may offer advantages over traditional statistical methods for certain tasks, they tend to use complex algorithms and are often regarded as analytical “black boxes”. Hence these novel methods pose new challenges of statistical literacy for producers and consumers of health research. Such challenges may be compounded by an underlying lack of communication and understanding between the statistics and ML/AI communities. Are statisticians slow to embrace the potential of ML and AI methods, and guilty of trying to protect their role in collaborative research in the face of competition from other fields? Or are they rightly concerned about the fundamentals of robust, reproducible and interpretable research being forgotten in the clamour for applying fashionable methods understood by few? This meeting will explore issues in statistical literacy raised by the growth of ML and AI in health research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based medicine relies on using data to provide recommendations for effective treatment or prevention decisions. However, in many settings, effects may be heterogeneous across individuals, and within individuals over time. Healthcare providers are faced with the daunting task of making sequential therapeutic decisions having seen few patients with a given clinical history. Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) operationalize the sequential decision-making process in the precision medicine paradigm, offering statisticians principled estimation tools that can be used to incorporate patient’s characteristics into a clinical decision-making framework so as to adapt the type, dosage or timing of intervention according to patients’ evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, new FIRRMA final regulations have been published to further clarify the definition of “sensitive personal data” which was previously left to be developed by CFIUS. The final regulations clarify the provision on genetic testing in two ways: 1) by focusing the definition on genetic tests and 2) by limiting the coverage of the rule to identifiable data. The final regulations implement CFIUS’s jurisdiction over 11 specific categories of sensitive personal data, including health, biometric, and genetic data. CFIUS now have expanded jurisdiction over U.S. companies that collect or maintain records relating to a U.S. citizen&amp;rsquo;s genetic information, such as a genetic test or individual or family history, which biotechnology or life sciences companies might collect and could lead to CFIUS review. CFIUS will closely monitor biotechnology and life sciences companies that operate in these relevant sectors and identify transactions in which a foreign investment raises a national security concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Airborne Transmission of the Virus SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624airborne-transmission-of-the-virus-sars-cov-2/</link>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624airborne-transmission-of-the-virus-sars-cov-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists realized soon after the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that airborne transmission, which is by inhalation of small airborne virus laden particles (often called aerosols), generated during human respiratory activities was the main mode of the spread of the infection. The prevailing theory of infection transmission, that it was via the direct contact with much bigger particles (often called droplets), leading to distancing at 6 feet arose from work by Flugge in 1897 and later theory by Well-Riley. Immediately upon the detection of the virus, Dr. Morawska and other aerosol experts recognized that the virus may be transmitted by much smaller particles than recognized by Flugge, over longer distances (as far as 60 feet and further) and lingering longer in the air. This is a major change in understanding and public health implications of virus transmission. WHO guidance was modified to reflect the possibility of virus transmission over longer distances and lingering longer in the air. It is expected that this will lead to changes in public health policy regarding mask usage, and ventilation of buildings and other areas people may gather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the era of precision medicine, survival outcome data with high-throughput covariates and predictors are often collected. These high dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability because of overfitting. This short course will introduce various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high dimensional predictors. I will cover statistical principles and concepts behind the methods, and will also discuss their applications to the real medical examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time permitting, I intend to cover the following topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survival analysis overview: basic concepts and models, e.g. Cox, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Censored Quantile Regression (CQR) Models;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survival models with high dimensional predictors (p&amp;gt;n): Regularized methods and Dantzig selector;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survival analysis with ultra-high dimensional predictors (p&amp;raquo;n): Screening Methods, e.g, Principled sure independent screening (PSIS), Conditional screening, IPOD, Forward selection, etc;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inference for survival models with high dimensional predictors (p&amp;gt;n).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience only needs to have some basic knowledge of regression analysis and survival analysis. The relevant papers and software for this short course can be found in: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yili/resindex.html&#34;&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yili/resindex.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ISSI Online Seminar Series: Confident Directional Selective Inference, from Multiple Comparisons with the Best to Precision Medicine</title>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MCB (multiple comparisons with the best, 1981, 1984), comparing treatments to the best without knowing which one is the best, can be considered an early example of selective inference. With the thinking that &amp;ldquo;there is only one true best&amp;rdquo;, the relevance of MCB to this presentation is it led to the Partitioning Principle, which is essential for deriving confidence sets for stepwise tests. Inference based on confidence sets control the directional error rate, inference based on tests of equalities may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA gave Accelerated Approval to Aduhelm^{TM} (aducanumab) for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) on 8 June 2021, based on its reduction of beta-amyloid plaque (a surrogate biomarker endpoint). When clinical efficacy of a treatment for the overall population is not shown, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often used to discover SNPs that might predict efficacy in subgroups. In the process of working on GWAS with real data, we came to realization that, if one causal SNP makes its zero-null hypothesis false, then all other zero-null hypotheses are statistically false as well. While the majority of no-association null hypotheses might well be true biologically, statistically they are false (if one is false) in GWAS. I will indeed illustrate this with a causal SNP for the ApoE gene which is involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid plaque in AD. We suggest our confidence interval CE4 approach instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted therapies such as OPDIVO and TECENTRIQ naturally have patient subgroups, already defined by the extent to which the drug target is present or absent in them, subgroups that may derive differential efficacy. An additional danger of testing equality nulls in the presence of subgroups is that the illusory logical relationships among efficacy in subgroups and their mixtures created by exact quality nulls leads to too drastic a stepwise multiplicity reduction, resulting in inflated directional error rates, as I will explain. Instead, Partition Tests, which would be called Confident Direction methods in the language of Tukey, might be safer to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistical prediction models for estimating probabilities have gained popularity in applied research. An adaptation to a new population can be achieved by calibrating the model to the characteristics of the target population, and numerous calibration techniques exist. In this presentation, I will provide a review of the different calibration approaches used in classical statistics and in machine learning for two-class probability estimation. I will present results of a comprehensive analysis using both simulated and real data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An objective of randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines is to develop evidence for whether and how antibody biomarkers can be appropriately used as surrogate endpoints for accelerating approval and increasing distribution of effective vaccines. I will summarize the COVID-19 Prevention Trial Network’s harmonized statistical analysis plan for generating this evidence based on the analysis of several phase 3 trials. The statistical methods include causal inference methods within the principal stratification, controlled effects, stochastic interventional effects, and mediation frameworks. The webinar seeks to describe the distinct contributions of the different methods and a strategy for synthesizing the set of results. The webinar also considers how the analyses can account for the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which may impact vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring patients&#39; safety in clinical trials is extremely important and is a major responsibility of the sponsors of the clinical trials. Regulatory authorities also encourage aggregate review of safety from ongoing clinical trials, specifically to identify potential risks of adverse events of special interest. Sponsors may decide that a blinded review of safety data can meet these needs while also ensuring clinical trial integrity. A Bayesian methodological framework has been developed that leverages historical data of the background rates of events of interest to monitor and detect potential safety signals using blinded data from ongoing clinical trials. This new method is a two‐step Bayesian evaluation of potential safety signals composed of a screening analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis. The blinded safety teams can use these steps to make an informed decision if any events of interest should be escalated for unblinded review.&lt;br&gt;
To ease implementation and operationalization of the method, an R package called BDRIBS (Bayesian Detection of potential Risk using Inference on Blinded Safety data) and an associated R-Shiny application have been developed. The R-package and the R-Shiny tool are both publicly available.&lt;br&gt;
The first part of the presentation will focus on the methodological development and the second part will feature the BDRIBS R-Shiny application to illustrate visualization and assessment of the events of interest to help in exploration of various scenarios and sensitivity analyses in real‐time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden. The first approach involves obtaining individual patient input on the relative priority of outcomes through preference instruments based on, for example, item response theory or discrete choice modeling. The second approach adapts inverse reinforcement learning to infer physician outcome priorities, allowing for the possibility of errors in decision making. Both approaches are illustrated with practical examples from mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Registration fee: €80&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with a graphical approach to bootstrapping and permutation testing, illuminating basic statistical concepts of standard errors, confidence intervals, p-values and significance tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider a variety of statistics (mean, trimmed mean, regression, etc.), and a number of sampling situations (one-sample, two-sample, stratified, finite-population), stressing the common techniques that apply in these situations. We’ll look at applications from a variety of fields, including telecommunications, finance, and biopharm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods let us do confidence intervals and hypothesis tests when formulas are not available, so we can do better statistics, e.g. use robust methods like medians, trimmed means, or robust regression. They can help clients understand statistical variability. And some of the methods are more accurate than standard methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Agent-based models (ABMs) are computational models used to simulate the actions and interactions of agents within a system. Usually, each agent has a relatively simple set of rules for how it responds to its environment and to other agents. These models are used to gain insight into the emergent behavior of complex systems with many agents, in which the emergent behavior depends upon the micro-level behavior of the individuals. ABMs are widely used in many fields, and this talk emphasizes the challenges that arise in the context various risk analyses (e.g., epidemics, invasive species, insurance). Relatively little work has been done on statistical theory for such models, this talk also points out some of those gaps and recent strategies to address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health economics has become an increasingly important discipline in medical research. Bodies such as NICE provide guidance based on health economic evaluation. Much of recent research has focused on using advanced statistical decision theoretic approaches in health economic evaluation studies where the interest is in the analysis of a multivariate outcome comprising of clinical benefit and associated costs. Missing data on one or both outcomes is common in these studies. The complex structure of the relationships between the outcomes makes handling missing data more challenging in these studies. In this talk the issues related to missing data in health economic evaluation studies will be discussed and novel statistical models developed to handle missing data using a full Bayesian approach will be described, using as motivating example a pilot study conducted at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The training will provide intermediate to advanced learners with a solid data science foundation to address challenges related to collecting, managing, processing, interrogating, analyzing and interpreting complex health and biomedical datasets using R. Participants will gain skills and acquire a tool-chest of methods, software tools, and protocols that can be applied to a broad spectrum of Big Data problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the mathematical algorithms, statistical computing methods, software tools, and health analytics, we will discuss a number of driving motivational problems. These will ground all the subsequent scientific discussions, data modeling, and computational approaches. The training will involve active-learning and integrate driving motivational challenges with mathematical foundations, computational statistics, and modern scientific inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on open-science principles, training will focus on effective, reliable, reproducible, and transformative data-driven discovery. Trainees will develop scientific intuition, computational skills, and data-wrangling abilities to tackle Big biomedical and advanced health data problems. The instructor will provide well-documented R-scripts and software recipes implementing atomic data-filters, as well as complex end-to-end predictive big data analytics solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Real-world data (RWD) have played an increasingly important role in healthcare decisions, for example supporting the design, analysis, and contextualization of clinical trials. In this webinar, we invite panelists from industry with backgrounds in statistics, clinical trials, data science, epidemiology, and health outcomes research to discuss novel applications where RWD can be used to support clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss propensity-score based methods to leverage RWD as an external data source to augment single-arm clinical trials, enhanced extrapolation of long-term clinical trial survival outcomes using electronic health record (EHR)-derived RWD, and enrollment projection for a prospective pragmatic trial design that utilizes RWD. Finally, we tie the three topics together with a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As policymakers and community leaders have worked to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that statistics and data science can play a critical role in protecting public health and determining the best path forward. Moving from theory to practice presents challenges for working with a patchwork of data from many different sources across public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers will discuss how their work in modeling, inference, predictive analysis, and machine learning has been applied to track the spread of COVID-19, drug use, air pollution, and human trafficking. Panelists will explore the strengths and weaknesses of available surveillance data and how to integrate and draw insight from multiple imperfect data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses the history and characteristics of the R software. R began, 20-odd years ago, as the open source clone of the S software. So the story of R has to start with S and with its history. S came from the Statistics and Data Analysis Research group at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that the design goal of S, and so of R, is to support studies in what we&amp;rsquo;d now call data science. The principles resulting from this goal are still central to computing for data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year on after the final ICH E9 estimands addendum was published, we bring estimands to life. Members of the Estimands in Oncology special interest group will describe how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be guided through a case study and interactively deepen the knowledge to gain hands-on experience in developing estimands. You will be introduced to the background and disease context of the case study, the concept of an estimand, and important clinical events (increased dropout rate and crossover therapy) that occurred in the trial and affected interpretation of the results. Using non-technical language and clear graphical presentation of the concepts, you will experience how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments, their regulatory agencies and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies informing the healthcare payers have the ambition of providing patients with fast access to evidence-based innovations in healthcare. The historical split in objectives and responsibilities of the regulators and the HTA bodies can be seen as one of the reasons for the growing evidence gap remaining after the private sector has performed the trials needed to bring their product to the market. Regulators and HTA bodies differ in their recommendations on patient population, comparators and trial endpoints. The confirmatory trials asked by the regulators may not be fit for purpose to perform HTA nor to inform physicians wanting to practice evidence-based medicine. A better alignment of evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers could accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional option is to perform the missing comparative effectiveness trial in the post-marketing phase. Most informative to healthcare decision-makers are practice-oriented, also named pragmatic trials. Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator. Practice-oriented trials lead to real-world evidence and have proven to be practice-changing. A clear pathway towards the realization of such efficient trial methods is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEY TAKEWAYS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient access to evidence-based innovations can be accelerated if practice-oriented trials are timely conducted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitators would be an alignment of the evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers as well as a framework for an efficient conduct of trials based on coded electronic health records.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>ASA BIOP Webinar: Generalized Pairwise Comparisons for Benefit/Risk Assessment in Personalized Medicine </title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210527asa-biop-webinar-generalized-pairwise-comparisons-for-benefit-risk-assessment-in-personalized-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A novel statistical approach to the analysis of randomized clinical trials uses all pairwise comparisons between two patients, one in the treatment arm and one in the control arm. Each pair favors treatment (“win”), control (“loss”), or neither. The “net treatment benefit” is the difference between the proportion of wins minus the proportion of losses. Pairwise comparisons can incorporate several outcomes of interest and several thresholds of clinical relevance in the analysis, and as such, they can be used to personalize treatment choices and to assess the benefit/risk of randomized therapeutic interventions in a rigorous yet flexible manner (Buyse 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages and limitations of generalized pairwise comparisons will be illustrated using two typical examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a single time-to-event endpoint, the net survival benefit is a meaningful measure of treatment effect whether or not hazards are proportional. When a delayed treatment effect is anticipated, for example in immune-oncology trials, the net benefit is appealing because it stresses benefits that are clinically worthwhile on the time scale. The test based on the net survival benefit can also gain power as compared to the traditional logrank test if interest focuses on long-term survival differences (Péron 2016a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anticancer treatment have substantial toxicities that may counterbalance treatment benefits. Generalized pairwise comparisons can be used to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments. This will be illustrated using several randomized trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Péron 2016b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not always clear how to adjust for control data in causal inference, balancing the goals of reducing bias and variance. We show how, in a setting with repeated experiments, Bayesian hierarchical modeling yields an adaptive procedure that uses the data to determine how much adjustment to perform. The result is a novel analysis with increased statistical efficiency compared to the default analysis based on difference estimates. We demonstrate this procedure on two real examples, as well as on a series of simulated datasets. We show that the increased efficiency can have real-world consequences in terms of the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. We also discuss the relevance of this work to causal inference and statistical design and analysis more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Professor Bianca De Stavola will discuss how life course investigations may characterise the impact of exposures over time (e.g., continuous or time-specific) and across dimensions (e.g., via joint or distinct pathways), and how different study designs may aid them. She will also compare ‘traditional’ approaches to gather evidence for causality and potential areas of intervention with the formality and clarity of counterfactual-based estimands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASA BIOP Webinar: Graphical approaches for the control of generalized error rates</title>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210520asa-biop-webinar-graphical-approaches-for-the-control-of-generalized-error-rates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this presentation, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on clinical trial case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer vision application in the medical domain have recently become quite popular. Detecting, localizing, and diagnosing diseases and recognizing structures on MRI, CT, PET, XRay, ultrasound and photographic images is efficiently done by AI. What is rarely discussed, is how these AI systems are made. They require copious amounts of training data consisting of images and human-supplied labels. The labels are marked areas (either rectangles or free-form boundaries) that are attached to a word, e.g. “tumor.” Naturally, only highly qualified professionals are able to provide these labels making the process effortful and expensive. A technique called “active learning” from AI can help with this by reducing the manual effort by 90%. This allows the creation of state-of-the-art AI models for medicine using a significantly smaller budget of time and resources. This talk will present the method with several examples and will argue that this approach is a disruptive shift in medical AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past year has seen a huge increase in the communication of statistical, medical, and public health concepts, methods, and results to broad audiences.  The general public has been exposed to the ideas of reproduction numbers, exponential growth, randomized trials, and the challenges of program evaluation in ways that had rarely been seen at such a large scale.  This webinar will provide a discussion between two experts in scientific communication&amp;ndash;Jenn Dowd, co-founder of Dear Pandemic and Associate Professor at the University of Oxford, and Ed Yong, staff writer at The Atlantic. They will discuss what they have learned during the course of the pandemic about communicating statistical/epidemiological concepts to broad audiences, what challenges remain, and how might we best address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has deeply penetrated the neuroimaging field in the past 15 years, by providing a means to construct imaging signatures of normal and pathologic brain states on an individual person basis. In this talk, I will discuss examples from our laboratory’s work on imaging signatures of brain aging and early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as brain cancer precision diagnostics and estimation of molecular characteristics. I will discuss some challenges, such as disease heterogeneity, integration of data from multiple sites, and derivation of interpretable statistical maps from certain machine learning tools, and will present some of our work in these directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applications of single-cell RNA sequencing in various biomedical research areas have been blooming. This new technology provides unprecedented opportunities to study disease heterogeneity at the cellular level. However, unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including large dimensionality, high dropout rates, and possibly batch effects, bring great difficulty into the analysis of such data. Not appropriately addressing these issues obstructs true scientific discovery. Herein, we propose a unified Regularized Zero-inflated Mixture Model framework designed for scRNA-seq data (RZiMM-scRNA) to simultaneously detect cell subgroups and identify gene differential expression based on a developed importance score, accounting for both dropouts and batch effects. We conduct extensive empirical investigation to demonstrate the promise of RZiMM-scRNA in comparison to several popular methods, including K-means and Hierarchical clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Competing risks data arise frequently in clinical and epidemiologic studies. Such data are characterized by a survival time that terminates due to one of several mutually exclusive causes. This webinar will cover the following: the two most commonly adopted frameworks for competing risks data; relevant estimands and estimators within each framework; the role of censoring as a competing risk; available modeling strategies; and causal inference in the competing risks setting. The main ideas will be illustrated through several real-data examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designs of clinical trials with time to event primary endpoints usually rely on hazards being constant over time. A major challenge in immuno-oncology is the delayed onset of benefit with such therapies and the presence of non-proportional hazards. The impact of this needs to be accounted for in sample size calculations, analysis methodology and reporting. In this meeting we will examine possible strategies to handle such features, which may not be fully known when the trial is initiated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report, nearly 70% Phase II trials failed to move forward to Phase III. Part of the reasons caused such high failure rate could be inefficient trial design and trial monitoring. In this talk, we introduce the concept of dynamic data monitoring (DDM) for ongoing clinical trials. We develop the principles and procedures for dynamically monitoring on-going clinical trials and demonstrate that the accumulative treatment effect can be automatically estimated and continuously accessible over the information time. Building on the adaptive group sequential (AGS) methods, and by taking the advantage of modern eClinical technologies, we developed a clinical trial “radar” system on which the Wald statistics, conditional power, trend, timing for sample size re-estimation, alerting of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility can be automatically displayed. Thus, the trail can be intelligently monitored. Through simulation, we demonstrate the power of DDM in guiding a promising trial to success or detecting a “hopeless” trial to stop. We provide an example of DDM application in the 1st remdesivir trial in Wuhan China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent discoveries from large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have raised the prospect of using polygenic risk scores in routine health care setting for the prediction of future incidence of large variety of complex diseases. However, as GWAS studies to date have been heavily biased towards European origin populations, current polygenic risk scores often underperform in non-European populations and thus use of them can further exacerbate healthcare inequality. In this talk, I will review simple and advanced statistical methods for generating polygenic risk score using high-dimensional SNP data and describe theoretical characterizations of their expected performance, both in the population that underlies original studies and in a different population that is expected to have different distribution of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (SNP-correlation). I will further describe novel Bayesian and machine learning based methods for building polygenic risk scores that can borrow information across GWAS studies of different ethnic groups, and thus makes best use of available data to generate more powerful polygenic risk scores across different ethnic groups. I will demonstrate potential utility for PRS in precision medicine using our recent studies on breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use of open access software, especially R,  is becoming prevalent in pharma. There is a tremendous amount of interest, but many do not understand the basic landscape regarding regulators’ thoughts, the groups that have been working in this area and what has already been accomplished.  This meet-up will discuss this topic from different viewpoints, including an expert from the R Validation Hub (the group that has probably given the deepest thought to this topic), regulatory, and practitioners who have used open access software for submissions in the device field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course will be a reprise of the main topics of the book by the same name, by Tucker McElroy and Dimitris Politis. The intended audience includes statisticians with little or no knowledge of time series, but a general knowledge of statistics. Prerequisites include a course on linear models, a course on mathematical statistics (such concepts as bias, variance, and the Gaussian distribution), and a familiarity with linear algebra (the transpose, inverse, and eigen-values of a matrix). The aim is to cover basic concepts of time series analysis at a level suitable for those with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s or master&amp;rsquo;s degree in statistics, while including a few non-standard concepts such as volatility filtering and time series bootstraps. A second aim is to incorporate coding in R of all concepts, methods, and examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop applies the Causal Roadmap to estimate the causal effects with multiple intervention variables, such as the cumulative effect of an exposure over time, controlled direct effects, and effects on survival-type outcomes with right-censoring. We will cover longitudinal causal models, identification in the presence of time-dependent confounding; and estimation of joint treatment effects using G-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner. During the workshop session, participants will work through the Roadmap using an applied example and implement these estimators with the ltmle R package. Prior training in causal inference in a single time-point setting is strongly recommended, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In modern drug development, the broader availability of high-dimensional observational data provides opportunities for scientist to explore subgroup heterogeneity, especially when randomized clinical trials are unavailable due to cost and ethical constraints. However, a common practice that naively searches the subgroup with a high treatment level is often misleading due to the “subgroup selection bias.” More importantly, the nature of high-dimensional observational data has further exacerbated the challenge of accurately estimating the subgroup treatment effects. To resolve these issues, we provide new inferential tools based on resampling to assess the replicability of post-hoc identified subgroups from observational studies. Through careful theoretical justification and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence intervals and debiased estimates for the selected subgroup treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. We further demonstrate the merit of the proposed methods by analyzing the UK Biobank data. The R package “debiased.subgroup&amp;quot; implementing the proposed procedures is available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will play the part of a sponsor consulting a statistician with the goal of designing a randomized trial with sample-size re-estimation. We will discuss the concept of conditional power and the promising-zone method, and we will present a pragmatic view of some issues, including when to plan the sample-size re-estimation in the course of the accrual, how to select the amount of sample-size increase, and how to operate such trials in practice. We will also discuss the pros- and cons- of using this type of design in relation to the clinical setting in which the trial is designed and endpoints it uses. Moreover, we will discuss the regulators’ views and illustrate our discussion with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic control arms leverage real world data from various sources or evaluations of historical clinical data to demonstrate the positive effects of a new therapy or treatment, without the need to use a placebo or standard of care as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in both the United States and Europe have responded positively to the use of SCAs in clinical development. While implementation of this method for regulatory purposes might be a new development, the majority of statistical and mathematical theories used for the design of SCAs are decades old and familiar to the scientific community. However, synthetic control arm studies are often subject to many misplaced industry myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this webinar our panel of expert speakers from Cytel, Roche and CIOX Health, will share their insights and bust Real-World Data industry myths around the use of synthetic controls in research and regulatory applications. In addition, they will dispel and bust a number of myths related to their specific sector of industry, namely pharma, data vendor, and consulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first provide a historical overview of the epidemic in Wuhan. I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates. I will also present the analysis results of &amp;gt;500,000 participants of the HowWeFeel project on health outcomes and behaviors in US, and discuss the factors associated with infection, behavior, and vaccine hesitancy. I will provide several takeaways and discuss priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a statistically optimal approach to construct data-driven decisions for stochastic optimization problems. Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The growth of availability and variety of healthcare data sources has provided unique opportunities for data integration and evidence synthesis, which can potentially accelerate knowledge discovery and enable better clinical decision making.  However, many practical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, high-dimensionality and heterogeneity across different datasets, remain to be addressed. In this talk, I will introduce several methods for effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data. Our algorithms are able to account for heterogeneity across different datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms, and examples of implementing the algorithms to real-world clinical research networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning. In this talk, I will discuss a novel framework, namely neural interaction detector (NID), for interpreting complex neural networks by detecting statistical interactions captured by the neural networks. Furthermore, we can construct a more interpretable generalized additive model that achieve similar prediction performance as the original neural networks. Experiment results on several applications, such as recommender systems, image recognition, sentiment prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of NID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Veridical Data Science for biomedical discovery: detecting epistatic interactions with epiTree</title>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a pillar of A.I. and has driven most of recent cutting-edge discoveries in biomedical research. In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the &amp;ldquo;dangers&amp;rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional vaccine clinical development is an undertaking involving meticulous, multiple studies in multiple populations at risk of infection and disease over multiple years. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine development is following this traditional development pathway, but accelerated Phase I-II-III clinical programs are being applied (c.f., USA FDA guidances 2020). This is not the first time vaccines have been manufactured and tested quickly to meet a public health crisis (1976, 2009). Selected statistical concepts pertaining to vaccine efficacy and safety, relevant during the design and implementation of such crisis programs, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this event was to shed light on and explain the main features (pro and con) that surround some of the controversies on use of p-values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Berger (Duke University) has been exploring the Bayesian and frequentist foundations of statistics for 50 years, and has recently been heavily involved in bringing these foundational perspectives to the p-value debate. David Trafimow (New Mexico State University) started the serious questioning of any use of p-values via the journal he edits, and Deborah Mayo (Virginia Tech) has developed a reformulation of frequentist error statistical methods within a full-blown philosophy of learning from error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session I: A Robust Sentinel System for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: In response to new legislative mandates and the desire to diversify scientific expertise and enhance core key capabilities in the Sentinel System, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has awarded a new five-year contract that establishes a new organizational structure for the Sentinel Coordinating Center. This new contract builds on FDA successes integrating the active, post-market safety surveillance into regulatory decision-making. This session will feature key leads from each Sentinel coordinating center who will discuss plans on how to advance and transform Sentinel’s data infrastructure into a national resource for evidence generation. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for collaboration to broaden stakeholder involvement, improve access to new data sources and analytic tools, and ensure more efficient and effective safety surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session II: Building the BEST Network and Establishing New Capabilities for the Surveillance of Biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: Launched in 2017, the BEST Initiative enacts the Agency’s mandate to implement active surveillance for biologic products. This session will highlight key achievements of BEST over the last year enhancing its capabilities to execute safety and effectiveness surveillance and inform regulatory decision making. CBER representatives will discuss ongoing work to support the expansion of the BEST data network and methods infrastructure as well as specific studies utilizing the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session III: Leveraging the Sentinel Initiative for COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: The U.S. FDA’s Sentinel Initiative is engaged in numerous activities to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will highlight key ongoing efforts across CDER and CBER to leverage Sentinel data infrastructure to describe course of illness, and evaluate the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of available COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Objective: In response to new legislative mandates and the desire to diversify scientific expertise and enhance core key capabilities in the Sentinel System, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has awarded a new five-year contract that establishes a new organizational structure for the Sentinel Coordinating Center. This new contract builds on FDA successes integrating the active, post-market safety surveillance into regulatory decision-making. This session will feature key leads from each Sentinel coordinating center who will discuss plans on how to advance and transform Sentinel’s data infrastructure into a national resource for evidence generation. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for collaboration to broaden stakeholder involvement, improve access to new data sources and analytic tools, and ensure more efficient and effective safety surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session II: Building the BEST Network and Establishing New Capabilities for the Surveillance of Biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: Launched in 2017, the BEST Initiative enacts the Agency’s mandate to implement active surveillance for biologic products. This session will highlight key achievements of BEST over the last year enhancing its capabilities to execute safety and effectiveness surveillance and inform regulatory decision making. CBER representatives will discuss ongoing work to support the expansion of the BEST data network and methods infrastructure as well as specific studies utilizing the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session III: Leveraging the Sentinel Initiative for COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: The U.S. FDA’s Sentinel Initiative is engaged in numerous activities to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will highlight key ongoing efforts across CDER and CBER to leverage Sentinel data infrastructure to describe course of illness, and evaluate the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of available COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are increasingly living in a data driven world. Data are collected in many different ways for a variety of purposes. As such concerns around protecting the privacy of individuals have increased in recent times. Research into protecting the confidentiality of any data collected is an important and challenging area of research. In particular, there is often a trade-off between protecting confidentiality and preserving the utility in the data. This meeting seeks to explore and address issues of protecting confidentiality and privacy when it comes to collecting clinical trial and medical/health data. The session speakers comprise some of the world leaders and experts in the field bringing together researchers from both academia and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-proportional Hazards&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster Randomization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hree Armed Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison.  In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistics and optimization are two of the foundational pillars of machine learning, and it is well recognized that optimization provides powerful tools for statistics. In recent years, techniques of the complementary nature, i.e., using statistics to improve optimization algorithms, have become increasingly successful. In this talk, we present several recent works on such statistical optimization methods. First, we discuss how to use statistical hypothesis testing to automatically adjust the learning rate of stochastic gradient methods in training deep neural networks. Then we overview some recent advances in structured nonconvex optimization using stochastic variance reduction techniques. Finally we will briefly explain how to leverage statistical preconditioning to accelerate distributed optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The R language is used extensively throughout the pharmaceutical industry. But its use within the tightly regulated clinical reporting workflows has remained limited. GSK Biostatistics has embarked upon a journey to embed R as a primary statistical analysis tool for clinical reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling R within a global department of over 600 Statisticians, Programmers and Data Scientists is challenging! It requires planning, patience, and a strong foundation that enables consistency across the enterprise. We invite you to learn more about how we achieved this at GSK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about our tidyverse-centric training program, a future-ready Working Area for R Programming (WARP) environment, and a leading-edge R for Clinical Reporting (R4CR) initiative. The goal: help embed R in every-day clinical reporting output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have changed the landscape of genomics research in complex biological systems by producing single cell resolution data at affordable costs. In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”? This is a very common misconception among data scientists, and a very broad definition of data science as a whole. For data science to be impactful, it needs to be credible, agile, and durable. To be able to do this, we need to embrace the differences between R vs. Python. Maybe you prefer R for data wrangling and Python for modeling - that’s great! Why should serious data science be stifled for the sake of language loyalty? Data science teams need to use the wealth of tools available to them to deliver the most impactful results. This webinar will be a discussion among data science leaders, debunking this common myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Almost Matching Exactly</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will present a matching framework for causal inference in the potential outcomes setting called Almost Matching Exactly. In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0. The biggest new idea in testthat 3.0.0 is the idea of an edition. You must deliberately choose to use the 3rd edition, which allows us to make breaking changes without breaking old packages. testthat 3e deprecates a number of older functions that we no longer believe are a good idea, and tweaks the behaviour of expect_equal() and expect_identical() to give considerably more informative output (using the new waldo package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testthat 3e also introduces the idea of snapshot tests which record expected value in external files, rather than in code. This makes them particularly well suited to testing user output and complex objects. I&amp;rsquo;ll show off the main advantages of snapshot testing, and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than our previous approaches of verify_output() and expect_known_output().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over a bunch of smaller quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to test reporting and improvements to expect_error(), expect_warning() and expect_message().&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the right dose in Phase 2 gives a potential new therapy its best chance to demonstrate efficacy during Phase 3. A well-executed dose-ranging trial therefore has the potential to alter the course of the entire clinical development program. This webinar demonstrates how adaptive and Bayesian techniques can be implemented for optimal dose-finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In social science we learn from stories.  The best stories are anomalous and immutable.  We shall briefly discuss the theory of stories, the paradoxical nature of how we learn from them, and how this relates to forward and reverse causal inference.  Then we will go through some stories of applied causal inference and see what lessons we can draw from them.  We hope this talk will be useful as a model for how you can better learn from own experiences as participants and consumers of causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Survival Analysis Designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and other complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at power analysis assuming complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as one candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepped-Wedge designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will introduce stepped-wedge designs and provide an insight into the more complex, flexible randomization schedules available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MAMs designs provide the ability to assess more treatments in less time than could be done with a series of two-arm trials and can offer smaller sample size requirements when compared to that required for the equivalent number of two-arm trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at the design of a Group Sequential MAMS design and explore its design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.&lt;br&gt;
We explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;The value of good design of experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider Bayesian statistics to answer your question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P-values is not always what you’re looking for&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications. Dynamic emails are a powerful way to meet decision makers where they live - their inbox - while displaying exactly the results needed to influence decision-making. Best of all, these notifications are crafted with code, ensuring your work is still reproducible, durable, and credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll demonstrate how this approach provides solutions for data quality monitoring, detecting and alerting on anomalies, and can even automate routine (but precisely formatted) KPI reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (drugs, knockouts, overexpression, etc.) in biology. In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the development of a framework that integrates observational and interventional data and allows predicting the effect of yet unseen interventions or transporting the effect of interventions observed in one context to another. I will present a framework for causal structure discovery based on such data and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable in this setting. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
