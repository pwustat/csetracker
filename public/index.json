Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.\n","date":1616166000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616166000,"objectID":"e2abca4c3d7812c447637ba1d2aef409","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","publishdate":"2021-03-16T10:10:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","section":"webinar","summary":"Online Seminar Series on  Mathematical Foundations of Data Science","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning.

In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the \u0026ldquo;dangers\u0026rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.\nIn this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.\n","date":1614360600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614360600,"objectID":"0c52ea2e23a6a0e1e84751b5e37050f3","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:47:29-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["WNAR"],"title":"Veridical Data Science for biomedical discovery: detecting epistatic interactions with epiTree","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Career Development"],"content":"","date":1614297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614297600,"objectID":"b2b47349b4687b705949c879a83bb569","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T19:28:27-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Career","PSI"],"title":"The Role of a Statistician","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Machine Learning"],"content":"Recording passcode: 6cleDgX+\nIn this talk, Dr. Wolf will provide an overview of common machine learning methods (e.g. ensemble methods, support vector machines and neural networks) and discuss currently implemented importance measures that provide semi-quantitative measures of associations between variables and outcome.\n","date":1614279600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614279600,"objectID":"49ec9e519d010468db23f37d6d5a7251","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:56:43-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","section":"webinar","summary":"Recording passcode: 6cleDgX+","tags":["ASA","SLDS"],"title":"Illuminating the Black Box: Variable Importance Measures for Interpretable Machine Learning","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Conference","Statistics","Data Science"],"content":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"4832ee05fca8c1885edd8e3349d56d49","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20210217csp/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T21:57:17-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210217csp/","section":"conference","summary":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":["ASA"],"title":"2021 ASA Conference on Statistical Practice","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Learn on history of bias and randomization in oncology clinical trials and how to think about what constitutes persuasive evidence of treatment efficacy and safety.\n","date":1613001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613001600,"objectID":"ca2c4bd77465990599747362b846e00b","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T10:58:52-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Oncology"],"title":"Bias and Randomization 1980 - 2020 - 2060","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Bringing estimands to life through a real case study.

This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.\n  Cluster Randomization\nCluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.\n  hree Armed Trials\nNon-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison. In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.\n ","date":1600214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600214400,"objectID":"c6d93f230683fd76a68f83e002ae149e","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:43:21-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Extending A Trial’s Design – Case Studies of Dealing with Study Design Issues","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Two papers were discussed:\n  Sebastian Häckl, Armin Koch \u0026amp; Florian Lasch, Empirical evaluation of the implementation of the EMA guideline on missing data in confirmatory clinical trials: Specification of mixed models for longitudinal data in study protocols, Pharmaceutical Statistics, 2019; volume 18, Issue 6, Pages 636-644.\n  Mutamba T.

In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.\n","date":1598572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598572800,"objectID":"9e5917d65f5d57a1d9bad2f984e170a5","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:20:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["RNA-seq"],"title":"Demystifying “Drop-Out” in Single Cell RNA-seq","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”?

In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.\n","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"241eba1bc389b177160e98424edd073d","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:13:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Causal Inference"],"title":"Almost Matching Exactly","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":" Important aspects of Phase II trials designs to consider Practical worked examples of MCP-Mod (continuous outcome) MCP-Mod (binary outcome) Fleming GST (binary outcome) ","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597708800,"objectID":"eae9ac0b5ce93b2d8c68710d350542b0","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:11:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs"],"title":"Adaptive Designs for Phase II Clinical Trials ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this webinar, I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0.

You must deliberately choose to use the 3rd edition, which allows us to make breaking changes without breaking old packages. testthat 3e deprecates a number of older functions that we no longer believe are a good idea, and tweaks the behaviour of expect_equal() and expect_identical() to give considerably more informative output (using the new waldo package).\ntestthat 3e also introduces the idea of snapshot tests which record expected value in external files, rather than in code. This makes them particularly well suited to testing user output and complex objects. I\u0026rsquo;ll show off the main advantages of snapshot testing, and why it\u0026rsquo;s better than our previous approaches of verify_output() and expect_known_output().\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;ll go over a bunch of smaller quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to test reporting and improvements to expect_error(), expect_warning() and expect_message().\n","date":1597276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597276800,"objectID":"9219a89f65812ac5a943b83f111560ef","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:06:10-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":null,"title":" testthat 3.0.0","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597276800,"objectID":"188b331f1b542dda759e474338325338","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813estimands-not-just-a-statistical-issue/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:08:51-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200813estimands-not-just-a-statistical-issue/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Estimand"],"title":"Estimands: Not Just a Statistical Issue","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Finding the right dose in Phase 2 gives a potential new therapy its best chance to demonstrate efficacy during Phase 3.

Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time.\nIn this webinar, we will introduce stepped-wedge designs and provide an insight into the more complex, flexible randomization schedules available.\nMulti-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS)\nMAMs designs provide the ability to assess more treatments in less time than could be done with a series of two-arm trials and can offer smaller sample size requirements when compared to that required for the equivalent number of two-arm trials.\nIn this webinar, we will look at the design of a Group Sequential MAMS design and explore its design requirements.\n","date":1595462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595462400,"objectID":"d7e78cc2b065c0b3b48c534a99d06008","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200723flexible-clinical-trial-design-survival-stepped-wedge-mams-designs/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:47:03-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200723flexible-clinical-trial-design-survival-stepped-wedge-mams-designs/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs","survival","Statsols"],"title":"Flexible Clinical Trial Design - Survival, Stepped-Wedge \u0026 MAMS Designs","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Epidemiology"],"content":"Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.\nWe explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.\n","date":1594944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594944000,"objectID":"1adb96d3cf2276cf7faf3f914cd23e24","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200717dahshu/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T15:04:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200717dahshu/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["causal effects","health outcome","experimental design"],"title":"Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":" The use of the estimand framework to assess and address pandemic-related disruptions Analysis strategies for pandemic-related missing and unobservable values ","date":1594911600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594911600,"objectID":"a6677d031645570f9752135ab9a0215b","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200716estimands-and-analysis-considerations-for-clinical-trials-impacted-by-covid-19/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:34:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200716estimands-and-analysis-considerations-for-clinical-trials-impacted-by-covid-19/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["COVID-19","Estimand","DIA"],"title":"Estimands and Analysis Considerations for Clinical Trials Impacted by COVID-19","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"","date":1594825200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594825200,"objectID":"becc88b7cd43e51c6a768129b051c396","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200715introduction-to-population-enrichment-trial-designs/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:26:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200715introduction-to-population-enrichment-trial-designs/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs"],"title":"Introduction to Population Enrichment Trial Designs","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"4 key learnings attendees will take away from this webinar:\n The value of good design of experiments Consider Bayesian statistics to answer your question P-values is not always what you’re looking for Adopt a life-cycle over the long-run, not just study by study ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"6a8c669d3b69740848cc6038efd5dc81","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200715good-statistical-practices-to-tackle-the-lack-of-reproducibility-in-preclinical-research/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:30:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200715good-statistical-practices-to-tackle-the-lack-of-reproducibility-in-preclinical-research/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Preclinical","PSI","Toxicology","Reproducibility"],"title":"Good Statistical Practices to Tackle the Lack of Reproducibility in Preclinical Research","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications.
