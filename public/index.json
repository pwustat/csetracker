I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates.

Existing association tests often suffer from insufficient power due to the substantially increased burden of multiple testing and correspondingly stringent multiple testing corrections that do not appropriately account for correlations. Using population-level whole-genome sequencing data, we propose a new statistical method to detect and localize rare and common risk variants based on a recently developed knockoff framework. The proposed approach includes a novel sequential knockoff generator for both rare and common variants in whole-genome sequencing studies, paired with a powerful screening method to comprehensively analyze rare and common variants across the genome. The proposed knockoff generator is scalable to large whole-genome sequencing datasets, and the screening method is powerful in detecting signals across the genome with guaranteed false discovery rate control. Furthermore, it can (1) prioritize causal variants over associations due to linkage disequilibrium thereby improving interpretability; (2) help distinguish the signal due to rare variants from shadow effects of significant common variants nearby; (3) integrate multiple knockoffs for improved power, stability and reproducibility; and (4) flexibly incorporate state-of-the-art and future association tests to achieve the benefits proposed here. In applications to whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and COPDGene samples from NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program we show that our method compared with conventional association tests can lead to substantially more discoveries, including several new ones and many previously implicated in GWAS studies on Alzheimer’s Disease and lung function phenotypes with much larger sample sizes.\n","date":1615593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615593600,"objectID":"eb185db7d94b21b67e641487b98e47c2","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210312identification-of-putative-causal-loci-in-whole-genome-sequencing-data-via-knockoff-statistics/","publishdate":"2021-03-10T18:03:21-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210312identification-of-putative-causal-loci-in-whole-genome-sequencing-data-via-knockoff-statistics/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["SFASA"],"title":"Identification of Putative Causal Loci in Whole-Genome Sequencing Data via Knockoff Statistics","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"Data Science is a pillar of A.I. and has driven most of recent cutting-edge discoveries in biomedical research. In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the \u0026ldquo;dangers\u0026rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.\nIn this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.\n","date":1614360600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614360600,"objectID":"0c52ea2e23a6a0e1e84751b5e37050f3","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:47:29-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["WNAR"],"title":"Veridical

Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.\nWe explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.\n","date":1594944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594944000,"objectID":"1adb96d3cf2276cf7faf3f914cd23e24","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200717dahshu/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T15:04:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200717dahshu/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["causal effects","health outcome","experimental design"],"title":"Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial","Statistics"],"content":" An overview of how COVID-19 progressed How can pharmaceutical companies be better prepared?
