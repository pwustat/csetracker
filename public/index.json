To improve long-term health outcomes for PWH, there is an urgent need to design personalized optimal cART with the lowest risk of comorbidity in the emerging field of precision medicine for HIV. Large-scale HIV studies offer researchers unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized cART in a data-driven manner. However, the large number of possible drug combinations for cART makes the estimation of cART effects a high-dimensional combinatorial problem, imposing challenges in both statistical inference and decision-making.

In this presentation, we describe the per-processing pipeline and quality control framework we have selected for the GENEtic SequencIng Study Hamburg-Davos (GENESIS-HD), a study involving more than 9000 human whole genomes. All samples were sequenced on a single Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with an average coverage of 35x using a PCR-free protocol and unique dual indices (UDI). For quality control, one genome-in-a-bottle (GIAB) trio was sequenced in triplicate, and one GIAB sample was sequenced 70 times in different runs. First, we explain the sequencing approach using illustrations. We describe important quality control metrics on the raw data (fastq file), after mapping and alignment (bam file), after variant calling (gvcf file) and multi-sample calling (msvcf file). We provide empirical data for efficient sample storage using original read archive (ORA) compression of fastq files. Finally, we sketch methods tailored for downstream association analysis and their incorporation in our analysis pipeline. The most important quality metrics for sample filtering were ancestry, sample cross-contamination, deviation from the expected Het/Hom ratio, relatedness, and too low coverage. We detected some patterns of sample cross-contamination which indicate cross-contamination through a multichannel pipette. When fastq files were compressed using ORA compression, the resulting file size was approximately 1/5 of the original file size, and compression time was linear to mismatch bases. In summary, the pre-processing, joint calling and QC of large WGS studies is nowadays feasible in reasonable time and efficient quality control procedures are readily available.\n","date":1674045000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674045000,"objectID":"fb1ac530298e9e8a7cf3cf9b7b5bbbee","permalink":"/webinar/20230118pre-processing-and-quality-control-of-whole-genome-sequencing-data/","publishdate":"2022-12-22T15:50:55-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20230118pre-processing-and-quality-control-of-whole-genome-sequencing-data/","section":"webinar","summary":"McGill University Biostatistics Seminars\n","tags":[],"title":"Pre-processing and Quality Control of Whole Genome Sequencing Data: A Case Study Using 9000 Whole Genomes from the GENESIS-HD Study","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"ASA Boston Chapter Webinar\nUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design the fit-for-purpose designation as a tool for drug development.

With either clinical trial or real-world evidence data, obtaining the underlying causal graph is always an important problem. Statistical methods for causal structural learning are often used to uncover the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from the data, and causal relationships among variables can be identified based on the estimated DAGs. In this presentation, I will introduce some recent works about statistical methods for Causal Structural Learning. The first part is the DAG estimation with application to longitudinal data. We proposed a novel statistical method to address the within-subject dependency as well as the cross-time causal relationships. We also proposed a condition called subgraph consistency to protect the cause-effect relationships at the current time point from being affected by future variables. In addition, we conducted extensive simulations to show the validity of our method in recovering the true underlying causal structure.\nIn the second part, I will introduce the impact of missing data and imputation methods in DAG estimation. We conducted a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of both PC-algorithm and GES method with different missing mechanisms including missing complete at random and missing at random. The simulation revealed the bias of both methods using complete case data and imputations methods for DAG estimation.\n","date":1670396400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670396400,"objectID":"0ce8042cefcfd1500c91a1f5b38ad4ef","permalink":"/webinar/20221207recent-development-in-statistical-methods-for-causal-structural-learning/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T11:38:40-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221207recent-development-in-statistical-methods-for-causal-structural-learning/","section":"webinar","summary":"ASA-BI-NESS Statistics Webinar\n","tags":[],"title":"Recent Development in Statistical Methods for Causal Structural Learning","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Hosted by the Boston Chapter of the ASA\nDr. DeGruttola\u0026rsquo;s research activities have focused on addressing concerns of communities most affected by the HIV epidemic through development and application of statistical methods required for appropriate public health response.

Succeeding founding Director Stephen Lagakos, Dr DeGruttola led the Statistical and Data Analysis Center for the Adult Project of the AIDS Clinical Trials group during the period in which highly active antiretroviral treatment was first introduced. A primary research focus was on development and analysis of appropriate marker-based endpoints that could be assessed more rapidly than clinical endpoints, but nonetheless provide reliable evidence for clinical benefit. More recently Dr. DeGruttola has focused on issues that arise in design, monitoring, and analysis of cluster randomized trials of HIV combination prevention programs; this work was motivated by his role in an HIV prevention trial in Botswana. Working with colleagues Ravi Goyal and Rui Wang, Dr. DeGruttola used simulation studies to investigate the properties of different study designs. This work led to development of novel network methods for incorporating uncertain information from a variety of sources in the creation of appropriate agent-based models.

The most critical phase of clinical development is the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 trials, with historical success rates around 40%. In other words, of all drugs that enter clinical development, 4 in 5 fail to get approved, and half of the failures occur in phase 3. The purpose of this talk will be to investigate statistical explanations for such a large proportion of failures, including the overestimation of treatment effects in phase 2 trials, the “winner’s curse”, and misinterpretation of P-values. These ideas will be explored through an informal discussion between a statistician and the head of a clinical development program. Moreover, Bayesian concepts will be explained in a non-technical manner and will be shown to lead to more sensible decision-making through an attenuation of the overestimation of treatment effects, and the replacement of P-values by posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n Phase II trials are likely to overestimate the magnitude of treatment effects P-values are frequently misinterpreted, which leads to a “replication crisis” Bayesian methods can address both the overestimation of treatment effects and the misinterpretation of P-values ","date":1670313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670313600,"objectID":"106684d631b722fca714ea0454c8aaf6","permalink":"/webinar/20221206iddi-webinar-why-do-so-many-phase-iii-clinical-trials-fail/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T11:29:32-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221206iddi-webinar-why-do-so-many-phase-iii-clinical-trials-fail/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IDDI Webinar: Why Do So Many Phase III Clinical Trials Fail?

However, with increasing advances in cancer treatment, demonstrating survival benefit within the context of a clinical trial is increasingly difficult. It can now take over a decade to show improvement to survival in certain indications, and in early lines of treatment, detecting the benefit of the drug of interest is confounded by patients moving on to subsequent therapies. In addition, survival data fails to capture the full range of outcomes that may matter to patients and physicians, including longer periods of disease remission or avoidance of side effects.\nThere is therefore an increasing urgency to determine how novel therapies should be assessed in the absence of survival data. Non-OS endpoints such as progression-free survival and minimal residual disease may provide an early prediction of survival and enable a more holistic assessment of a novel therapy, particularly when combined with patient reported outcomes. However, a lack of consensus over the value of non-OS endpoints, as well as concerns over their ability to translate into long term outcomes, are limiting the use of these endpoints in HTA decision-making.\nIn this webinar, representatives from different stakeholder groups (patients, physicians, health economists and industry) will discuss the value of increasing the use of non-OS endpoints in reimbursement decision-making to their stakeholder groups. Using the example of multiple myeloma, the speakers will discuss how and when non-OS endpoints should be used, to support a future in which assessments of novel therapies are more fit-for-purpose.\nLearning Objectives\n Discuss the key challenges with relying on Overall Survival (OS) benefit in HTA assessments in certain oncology indications. Understand the value of increasing the use of non-OS endpoints in reimbursement decision-making from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and health economists. Propose actions that can support the greater acceptance of non-OS endpoints and PROs in oncology to help patients access potentially life-extending therapies or therapies with improved outcomes in the absence of mature OS data.

There is an intrinsic interest of leveraging all available information for an efficient design and analysis. This allows trials with smaller sample size or with unequal randomization. Examples include early phases drug development, occasionally in phase III trial, and special areas such as medical devices, orphan indications and extrapolation in pediatric studies. Recently, 21st Century Cure Act and PUDUFA VI encourage the use of relevant historical data for efficient design. An appropriate statistical method in this context needs to leverage “borrowing” of information while considering the heterogeneity between historical and current trial. In this short course, I’ll cover different statistical frameworks to incorporate trial external evidence with real life example.\nThe course will begin with introducing the meta-analytic predictive (MAP) framework for borrowing historical data. The MAP approach is based on Bayesian hierarchical model which combines the evidence from different sources. It provides a prediction for the current study based on the available information while accounting for inherent heterogeneity in the data. This approach can be used widely in different applications of clinical trial. These applications will be demonstrated using the R package RBesT, the R Bayesian evidence synthesis tools, which are freely available from CRAN.\nIn the second part of the short course, we focus on the propensity score integrated power prior approach. The power prior is a useful class of informative priors for external control data. The power prior discounts the likelihood of the external control data directly using a power parameter. However, choice of the power parameter is tricky in the real-life applications. An integrated propensity score-based method along with prior power can be useful in this context. A two-stage provides a paradigm for conducting a comparative observational, non-randomized study within the premarket regulatory setting. The power parameters are calculated using trial data and external control divided into homogeneous strata using propensity score.\nMethodological and practical aspects will be discussed to facilitate real life implementation.\nOutline\nI.

New trial designs often depend on historical data, which, however, may not be accurate for the current study due to changes in study populations, patient heterogeneity, or different medical facilities. As a result, the original plan and study design may need to be adjusted or even altered to accommodate new findings and unexpected interim results.

These methods aim to increase the power and reduce sample size requirements while providing a safeguard against prior-data conflict (i.e. substantial differences between data sources). However some methods can increase the type I error rate, which may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities. Power and type I error rate are calculated using simulation, which can be done using a conditional (taking the historical data as fixed) or an unconditional approach (sampling also the historical data in the simulation).\nIn this talk we give a brief introduction to these borrowing methods and we discuss the ideas behind the unconditional and the conditional approach. We propose a framework for the unconditional approach that can incorporate a systematic bias of the historical data as well as between-study heterogeneity based on an assumption of exchangeability. In this framework, prior information on the similarity of the current trial and the historical data can be included. The framework is illustrated using a simulation study. The results of the unconditional approach show that if we assume exchangeability and no systematic bias of historical and current controls, a gain in power while keeping the type I error rate fixed is possible. Using the conditional approach it is difficult to incorporate knowledge on the similarity of the historical controls.\n","date":1669206600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669206600,"objectID":"9c10f568ec338781ebf7cd26a8165bd7","permalink":"/webinar/20221123calculation-of-power-and-type-i-error-rate/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:23:02-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221123calculation-of-power-and-type-i-error-rate/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Calculation of Power and Type I Error Rate of Methods for Borrowing Data from Historical Controls: Should We Sample the Historical Data?","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"University of Cambridge Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit Seminar\nElectronic Health Records (EHR) linked with other auxiliary data sources hold tremendous potential for conducting real time actionable research.

He pioneered almost all the main branches of statistics, but it is not as well known that he opened the area of Directional Statistics with his pioneering 1953 paper introducing the Fisher distribution on the sphere. He stressed that for spherical data one should take into account that the data is on a manifold. Since then, many extensions of this distribution have appeared bearing Fisher\u0026rsquo;s name. In fact, the subject of Directional Statistics has grown tremendously in the last two decades with new applications emerging in Life Sciences, Image Analysis and so on. Another area Fisher opened which I will consider is discriminant analysis in Multivariate Analysis. Several papers by him and others followed from his seminal paper in 1936 on Discriminant Analysis where he coined the name discrimination function. Now Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is an indispensable tool in Statistical Learning.\nOne of the features of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s work is that the starting point was often a motivating application from scientists and applied statisticians. For Directional Statistics, this was the problem of pole reversal raised by a geologist Mr J. Hospers. For Discriminant Analysis it was a set of cranial measurements taken by Mr E. R. Martin, who applied Discriminant Analysis to sex differences in measurements of the mandible. Further motivation was through the work of Miss Mildred Barnard in collecting and analysing a time series of skull measurements. However, in his 1936 paper, he first time introduces now celebrated iris data.\nIn this talk, first I will describe the Fisher distribution and reanalyse his geological data. He mentioned in the paper that it has two goals: the first to explore methodology for the analysis of widely dispersed measurements of direction such as frequently arise in geology; the second goal to illustrate the correct a pplication of fiducial inference. Regarding, the first goal the Fisher-von Mises distribution has become an essential tool for analysing spherical data but regarding his second goal on fiducial inference his achievement remains uncertain. Incidentally, Fisher derives, the von Mises distribution on the circle independently in 1959 as another example to illustrate the fiducial principle rather than analysing any circular data.\nWe will discuss the extension of the Fisher distribution on the sphere to hypersphere which is now known as the von Mises-Fisher distribution. In general, the maximum likelihood methods for directional distributions are not computationally straightforward and a new approach of the score matching estimate will be presented.\nComing back to the topic of discriminant analysis, historically, he wrote four papers on this topic during 1936-1940 and connected with the pioneering work in the same period of Hotelling and Mahalanobis. We revisit the famous iris data and answer one of the assumptions he points out in his work that he admits that he is assuming normality to assess the misclassification error, in particular. One of the most popular tests of normality is through my measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis and we give evidence that his assumption was well founded. We also indicate how the subject has moved due to the computer revolution and there are now new methods such as kernel classifier, classification trees, support vector machine, neural networks to carry out discriminant analysis. His work is a classical parametric work, but new advances have more of non-parametric flavour. Intersting that all these new analysis lead to similar conclusion as from Fisher\u0026rsquo;s LDA for the Iris data.\nOverall, with computational power, the whole subject of Multivariate Analysis has changed its emphasis. Deriving sampling distributions as one of the topics which Fisher pioneered has now moved to simulation methods, for example, to obtain percentage points. Boot strapping is another innovation. Now the topic of High Dimensional Data is another growing area and Cluster Analysis has become the topic of unsupervised learning. Finally, we end with a historical note pointing out some correspondence between D\u0026rsquo;Arcy Thompson (pioneer of Shape Analysis) and R A Fisher where we could have seen Fisher’s insight into Shape Analysis but this collaborative work via a Research Student did not materialise.\n","date":1668763800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668763800,"objectID":"92710e561e7f79eadc045564c57c4ce9","permalink":"/webinar/2022111840th-fisher-lecture/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:13:21-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/2022111840th-fisher-lecture/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"40th Fisher Lecture: Fisher's Legacy of Multivariate Analysis, Statistics on Manifolds, and Beyond ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"088494fa55fe10fa011453eaf35a9a44","permalink":"/conference/202211182022-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-research-design-berd-methods-conference/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T14:28:47-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/202211182022-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-research-design-berd-methods-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":[],"title":"2022 Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) Methods Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Science communication and storytelling with scientific data represent two distinct ways of constructing reality.

GWAS often requires genome-wide screening to identify ordinal or continuous genomic features that are associated with long-term treatment outcome; for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with time to cancer relapse. The estimated coefficient of a hazard rate regression model (HRRM, such as Cox’s model) has been a popular choice for a statistic to test for such associations. It will be demonstrated in this talk that in certain circumstances one runs into trouble with the HRRM approach.\nMotivated by this problem, a robust, completely nonparametric approach using Pearson’s or rank-based correlation has been developed. This method, called correlation profile test (CPT), is formed by the correlation profile statistic coupled with an accurate hybrid permutation test that combines permutation and asymptotic distribution. Statistical performances of CPT are compared with a few established methods by a simulation study and an analysis of a real GWAS dataset. It is shown that in cases where the proportional hazards assumption does not hold, CPT is much superior to the HRRM approach in terms of possessing higher statistical power and maintaining the nominal significance level. Only in the scenarios where the proportional hazards model holds exactly or approximately can CPT be inferior to the HRRM approach. Some analytical insight into this performance pattern will be presented. In summary, CPT is a complementary alternative to the HRRM approach in testing associations between two random variables one of which is a failure time subject to right censoring.\n","date":1668675600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668675600,"objectID":"02257c1d9e059865ae5f63732f1a9895","permalink":"/webinar/20221117nonparametric-failure-time-analysis/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:06:10-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221117nonparametric-failure-time-analysis/","section":"webinar","summary":"Texas A\u0026amp;M University Statistics Former Student Network (SFSN) Webinar\n","tags":[],"title":"Nonparametric Failure Time Analysis – Thinking Out of the “Cox-Regression Box” in Genomic Applications","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1668670200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668670200,"objectID":"d0ee967008a8d155eec42a9afe741cab","permalink":"/webinar/20221117dartmouth-area-sas-user-group-dasug-webinar/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:04:04-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221117dartmouth-area-sas-user-group-dasug-webinar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dartmouth Area SAS User Group (DASUG) Webinar: Getting Started With Survival Analysis","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1668643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668643200,"objectID":"c53c4bdabb815882265940f601394942","permalink":"/conference/20221117friends-of-cancer-research-annual-meeting-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T14:27:49-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20221117friends-of-cancer-research-annual-meeting-2022/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Friends of Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2022","type":"conference"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"€200\n","date":1668643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668643200,"objectID":"75ed01adbb486b6dae309df124be14bf","permalink":"/webinar/20221117precision-medicine-webinar/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T14:26:36-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221117precision-medicine-webinar/","section":"webinar","summary":"€200\n","tags":[],"title":"Precision Medicine Webinar","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"A common assumption of data analysis in clinical trials is that the patient population, as well as treatment effects, do not vary during the study. However, when trials enroll patients over several years, this hypothesis may be violated. Ignoring variations of the outcome distributions over time, under the control and experimental treatments, can lead to biased treatment effect estimates and poor control of false positive results. We propose and compare two procedures that account for possible variations of the outcome distributions over time, to correct treatment effect estimates, and to control type-I error rates. The first procedure models trends of patient outcomes with splines. The second leverages conditional inference principles, which have been introduced to analyze randomized trials when patient prognostic profiles are unbalanced across arms. These two procedures are applicable in response-adaptive clinical trials. We illustrate the consequences of trends in the outcome distributions in response-adaptive designs and in platform trials and investigate the proposed methods in the analysis of a glioblastoma

the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a dose initially developed for systemic chemotherapies, is by default selected for the Phase 3 confirmatory trial. With the advent of anti-cancer therapies such as molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies, a paradigm shift is underway from the use of conventional MTD approaches to improved dose selection strategies for oncology programs. In response to this new challenge, new study designs are needed to optimize dose selection while still bringing life-changing new therapies to patients as soon as possible. We propose a 2-in-1 adaptive design starting with a Phase 2 trial with randomized evaluation of two doses and only select one dose to expand to a Phase 3 trial if efficacy evidence is observed based on an interim evaluation. The low dose will be selected if both doses show promising efficacy unless the high dose demonstrates a more compelling treatment effect, and the study will be seamlessly expanded to a Phase 3 trial with the selected dose with patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion also used for the statistical inference in the Phase 3 portion. The overall Type I error can be controlled under a mild assumption. Simulation studies are conducted to confirm the control of Type I error and to demonstrate the desirable operating characteristics of the proposed design.\n","date":1668060000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668060000,"objectID":"d8d588d41c0c6a5b7edbc3e652491d4f","permalink":"/webinar/20221110a-2-in-1-adaptive-design-to-seamlessly-expand-a-selected-dose-from-a-phase-2-trial-to-a-phase-3-trial-for-oncology-drug-development/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T17:08:05-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221110a-2-in-1-adaptive-design-to-seamlessly-expand-a-selected-dose-from-a-phase-2-trial-to-a-phase-3-trial-for-oncology-drug-development/","section":"webinar","summary":"ASA-BI-NESS Statistics Webinar Series\n","tags":[],"title":"A 2-in-1 Adaptive Design to Seamlessly Expand a Selected Dose from a Phase 2 Trial to a Phase 3 Trial for Oncology Drug Development","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"University of Cambridge Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics Unit Seminar\nSurvival models — particularly those able to account for patient comorbidities via competing risks analysis — offer valuable prognostic information to clinicians making critical decisions and represent a growing area of application for machine learning approaches.

Their implementation can largely be thought of as codifying ‘good standard practice’ for interpreting and reporting classical p-values. Second-generation pvalues maintain the favorable properties of classical p-values while emphasizing scientific relevance to expand their utility, functionality, and applicability. In particular, they can report evidence in favor of the alternative, in favor of the null hypothesis, or neither (inconclusive); they automatically incorporate an adjustment for multiple comparisons and multiple looks; they have lower false discovery rates than classical p-values; and they are easier to interpret. Second-generation p-values have been shown to work well in regularized models. They also lead to significantly improved model selection procedures in linear and generalized linear models. Also, second-generation p-values are non-denominational in the sense that they are readily applied in frequentist, likelihood and Bayesian settings.\nOutline and Objectives:\nThis course will briefly revisit the history of p-values as originally envisioned in significance and hypothesis testing, and the resulting controversy over their scientific interpretation. The importance of distinguishing between three key inferential quantities (the measure of the strength of evidence, design error rates, and false discovery rates for observed data) will be illustrated. The second-generation p-value will be introduced and contrasted with standard methods. The workshop will explain how to design studies in which the second-generation p-value is used as the primary mode of inference. We will cover computation of second-generation p-values (in R), guidelines for presenting results, and when appropriate, how to present accompanying false discovery rates. Multiple examples will be presented using data from clinical trials, observations studies and high-dimensional analysis of large-scale data. Advanced applications in model selection, adaptive monitoring of clinical trials, and regularized models will be shown if time allows. Mathematical details will be kept to a minimum, e.g., statistical properties will be presented but without mathematical proof.\n","date":1667566800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667566800,"objectID":"0145ffdddea96764ac376aba956f37e3","permalink":"/course/20221104asa-virtual-short-course-an-introduction-to-second-generation-p-values/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:47:26-08:00","relpermalink":"/course/20221104asa-virtual-short-course-an-introduction-to-second-generation-p-values/","section":"course","summary":"ASA San Diego Chapter Members: $25; Non-members: $35\n","tags":[],"title":"ASA Virtual Short Course: An Introduction to Second-generation p-values and their Use in Statistical Practice","type":"course"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Sponsored by the International Society for Biopharmaceutical Statistics (ISBS)\nAdaptive platform trials provide a framework to simultaneously study multiple treatments in a disease. They are multi-arm trials in which interventions can enter as they become available and leave for futility or efficacy based on interim analyses or a final analysis. The attractiveness of platform trials compared to separate parallel-group trials is not only due to operational aspects as a shared trial infrastructure and more efficient patient recruitment, but also results from the possibility to share control groups, to efficiently identify non-efficacious treatments, and to allow direct comparisons between experimental treatment arms. However, the flexibility of the framework comes with challenges for statistical inference and the interpretation of trial results. The main challenges concern the adaptivity of platform trials (as decisions on adding or dropping arms cannot be fully pre-specified and may have an impact on current trial arms), multiplicity issues (due to multiple interventions, subgroups and interim analyses) and the use of shared controls (concurrent or non-concurrent controls, blinding for interventions that have different routes of administration, change in the standard of care).

In reality, an investigational product may only demonstrate activity for a subset of baskets, and the degree of activity may vary across the subset. A key benefit of our Bayesian model averaging approach is that it explicitly accounts for the possibility that any subset of baskets may have similar activity and that some may not. Our proposed approach performs inference on the basket-specific response rates by averaging over the complete model space for the response rates, which can include thousands of models. We present results that demonstrate that this computationally feasible Bayesian approach performs favorably compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, even when held to stringent requirements regarding false positive rates.\n","date":1667392200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667392200,"objectID":"d7a358f2a4fa94c995f1b86591cfb4df","permalink":"/webinar/20221102bayesian-adaptive-basket-trial-design-using-model-averaging/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T16:38:47-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221102bayesian-adaptive-basket-trial-design-using-model-averaging/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Adaptive Basket Trial Design Using Model Averaging","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"We explore common challenges faced when designing and conducting clinical trials with sample size re-estimation (SSR).

However, it is not always the case that a suitable control exists. Efficient statistical methodology is well studied in the setting of randomised controlled trials. This is not the case if one wishes to compare several experimental with no control arm. We propose hypothesis testing methods suitable for use in such a setting. These methods are efficient, ensuring the error rate is controlled at exactly the desired rate with no conservatism. This in turn yields an improvement in power when compared with standard methods one might otherwise consider using, such as a Bonferroni adjustment. The proposed testing procedure is also highly flexible. We show how it may be extended for use in multi-stage adaptive trials, covering the majority of scenarios in which one might consider the use of such procedures in the clinical trials setting.

When the pathogen of interest is transmissible between study subjects, interference may occur: individual infection outcomes may depend on treatments received by others. Contagion may induce causal dependence in outcomes, even in the absence of treatment. Epidemiologists have introduced several competing – and incompatible – formalisms for dealing with these problems. In this presentation, I will introduce a causal framework for understanding infectious disease transmission and the effects of interventions on infection outcomes. I will discuss a synthesis of two broad research efforts: causal inference for individual vaccine effects in observational and randomized trials, and population-level transmission modeling of the kind popularized during the COVID19 pandemic. I outline the causal structure of contagion, identification of meaningful individual effects, and generalization of these effects to counterfactual population-level epidemic trajectories. Finally, I describe some of the pitfalls of ignoring contagion in studies of infectious disease interventions.

If patients may deviate from their assigned treatments, then applying standard DTR methods produces causal estimates for the impact of the treatment assignment, not the treatment itself. The causal impact of treatment is often of substantive interest.

A key component of personalized medicine is the development of companion diagnostics that measure biomarkers, e.g., protein expression, gene amplification, or specific mutations. An in vitro companion diagnostic device (or test) is an in vitro diagnostic device which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. This short course will provide an overview of CDx validation including study designs for both analytical and clinical studies, and challenges. One of such challenges is how to assess the CDx clinical validly if trial assay (CTA) instead of CDx is used to classify patient biomarker status at the clinical trial enrollment in the clinical trial.

Master protocol, including umbrella, basket, and platform trials, promotes innovation in clinical trials and aims at improving efficiency, avoiding duplication and competition, and accelerating the drug development process. Though master protocols used to be primarily sponsored by nonprofit organizations, academic institutes and government agencies mostly in oncology area, there is a growing trend of conducting clinical trials using master protocol in recent years from the pharmaceutical industry in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Regulatory agencies across the globe have issued guidance on master protocols. In 2018, the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Oncology Scientific Working Group (SWG) was chartered to explore innovative statistics in oncology drug development and a sub-team on master protocol in oncology was formed. In this short course, instructors from the Oncology SWG master protocol sub-team will provide an overview on master protocol, its regulatory landscape, statistical methodologies, special statistical considerations, challenges and opportunities both statistically and operationally. The last part of this short course will include a case study of a COVID platform trial: RECOVERY Trial, with detailed illustrations on how to implement the considerations discussed in the earlier part of the short course.

Through carefully thought-out and planned adaptation, the right dose can be identified faster, patients can be treated more effectively, and treatment effects evaluated more efficiently.\nThis short course will introduce different types of adaptive designs tailored for adaptive dose finding and confirmatory clinical trials.

In addition, device development, as opposed to drug development, often occurs in an iterative manner with subsequent device generations being modified to a minor to moderate extent. Therefore, it is not surprising that many flexible study designs to leverage existing data (external to the current pivotal study) via innovative application of statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian, propensity score) have been adopted in the medical device area. In this talk, within the context of the recent FDA breakthrough program to ensure that patients with high unmet medical need (e.g., Heart Failures) have more timely access to innovative medical devices by expediting their development, we will share our experience in the need for seamless clinical trial design with the possibility to leverage a relevant external existing dataset via an improved dynamic borrowing method by taking clinical reasoning into account via equivalence margin-driven similarity measure to ensure any external data borrowing occurs only when the difference between the current and prior means falls within a pre-specified narrow margin.\nMain References:\n  Owen Faris, Jeffrey Shure (2017) \u0026ldquo;An FDA Viewpoint on Unique Considerations for Medical-Device Clinical Trials.\u0026rdquo; N Engl J Med 376:1350-1357 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1512592\n  Breakthrough Devices Program Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Document issued on December 18, 2018. https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/breakthrough-devices-program\n  Michael R.

This shift can be characterized at the micro level as a shift from asking “what have we controlled for in this model?” to asking “what have we chosen to ignore in this model, and at what cost?” At the macro level, it is a shift from viewing animals as tools (the furry test tube), to viewing them as patients in an equivalent human medical study, this includes providing for an animals welfare as well as experimental design and analysis techniques. Colleagues and I feel that we are witnessing the birth of a new discipline, which we have termed Therioepistemology, or the study of how knowledge is gained from animal research. In this talk, I’ll outline six questions that help critically evaluate animal-based biomedical research from a therioepistemological perspective. Ultimately, by formalizing therioepistemology as a discipline, we can begin to discuss best practices that will improve the reproducibility and translatability of animal-based research, with concomitant benefits in terms of human health, animal well-being, and scientific quality.\n","date":1664863200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664863200,"objectID":"da52c7fa395a813bf92e695fd2f2886e","permalink":"/webinar/20221004psi-pre-clinical-sig-webinar-therioepistemology/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T16:45:56-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20221004psi-pre-clinical-sig-webinar-therioepistemology/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PSI Pre-Clinical SIG Webinar: Therioepistemology – Rethinking How We Conduct Animal-based Experimentation","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664542800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664542800,"objectID":"17628fc5367f1a5e89749b600022c96e","permalink":"/webinar/20220930asa-san-francisco-bay-area-chapter-virtual-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T16:44:14-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220930asa-san-francisco-bay-area-chapter-virtual-seminar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA San Francisco Bay Area Chapter Virtual Seminar: A Bayesian Approach for Integrating External Data in Clinical Trials Using Overlap Prior","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664442000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664442000,"objectID":"144c9c783070a3e27b70e02ba7a4d98a","permalink":"/webinar/20220929asa-mental-health-statistics-section-webinar/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T16:39:58-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220929asa-mental-health-statistics-section-webinar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Mental Health Statistics Section Webinar: Learn then Test – Calibrating Predictive Algorithms to Achieve Risk Control ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"General Lecture: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic – A Statistician’s Reflection September 29, 2022, 12:30-1:30pm PDT\nTechnical Lecture: Ensemble Methods for Testing a Global Null Hypothesis September 30, 2022, 12:30-1:30pm PDT\n","date":1664409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664409600,"objectID":"f03a82b7077fadf9757c83677d8c405f","permalink":"/webinar/20220929canssi-2022-distinguished-lecture-series-in-statistical-sciences/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T16:41:36-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220929canssi-2022-distinguished-lecture-series-in-statistical-sciences/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"CANSSI 2022 Distinguished Lecture Series in Statistical Sciences","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Interpretable/explainable Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging field to address the black-box nature of complex models obtained by many popular ML methods.

(2020, JASA) studied the high-dimensional sparse penalized rank regression and established its nice theoretical properties. However, the computation of penalized rank regression can be very challenging for high-dimensional data, due to the highly nonsmooth rank regression loss. In this work we view the rank regression loss as a non-smooth empirical counterpart of a population level quantity, and a smooth empirical counterpart is derived by substituting a kernel density estimator for the true distribution in the expectation calculation. This view leads to the convoluted rank regression loss and consequently the sparse penalized convoluted rank regression (CRR) for high-dimensional data. Under the same key assumptions for sparse rank regression, we establish the rate of convergence of the $\\ell_1$-penalized CRR for a tuning free penalization parameter and prove the strong oracle property of the folded concave penalized CRR. We further propose a high-dimensional Bayesian information criterion for selecting the penalization parameter in folded concave penalized CRR and prove its selection consistency. We derive an efficient algorithm for solving sparse convoluted rank regression that scales well with high dimensions. Numerical examples demonstrate the promising performance of the sparse convoluted rank regression over the sparse rank regression. Our theoretical and numerical results suggest that sparse convoluted rank regression enjoys the best of both sparse least squares regression and sparse rank regression.\n","date":1664276400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664276400,"objectID":"b072f142b20361351ee35671b1940049","permalink":"/webinar/20220927asa-statistical-learning-and-data/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T16:33:48-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220927asa-statistical-learning-and-data/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Statistical Learning and Data Science Section Webinar: Sparse Convoluted Rank Regression in High Dimensions","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"University of Waterloo David Sprott Distinguished Lecture\n","date":1663851600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663851600,"objectID":"441996e3590d0f78d8dbad399fc6a581","permalink":"/webinar/20220922whatever-happened-to-design-based-inference/","publishdate":"2022-12-12T15:51:32-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220922whatever-happened-to-design-based-inference/","section":"webinar","summary":"University of Waterloo David Sprott Distinguished Lecture\n","tags":[],"title":"Whatever Happened to Design-Based Inference?","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"IDDI Webinar\n","date":1663833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663833600,"objectID":"6af1f7d713603125e5d27986f536ade5","permalink":"/webinar/20220922the-benefit-risk-assessment/","publishdate":"2022-12-12T15:49:13-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220922the-benefit-risk-assessment/","section":"webinar","summary":"IDDI Webinar\n","tags":[],"title":"The Benefit-Risk Assessment of New Treatment: The Health Technology Assessmen (HTA) Process","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" What the bootstrap method is and when it should be used.

The microbiome is a particularly attractive target for establishing new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, and for developing low-cost, low-risk interventions. Microbiome data have two unique features. First, they are compositional, i.e., the total number of sequencing reads per sample is an experimental artifact and only the relative abundance of taxa can be measured. Second, they are subject to a wide variety of experimental biases (e.g., in the process of DNA extraction and PCR amplification) that plague most analyses that directly analyze relative abundance data. These features call for analyses that are based on log-ratio transformation of the relative abundance data. Existing methods often ignore experimental biases, do not handle the extensive (50-90%) zero count data adequately, and do not accommodate other complexities in microbiome data (e.g., high-dimensionality, confounding covariates, and continuous covariates of interest). In this talk, we present a new logistic-regression-based method that takes into account all of these features of microbiome data for robust testing of differential abundance. Our simulation studies indicate that our method is the only one that universally controls the FDR while at the same time maintaining good power. We illustrate our method by the analysis of a throat microbiome dataset.\n","date":1663063200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663063200,"objectID":"a591e6db33de9261f8b5f2977575fef0","permalink":"/webinar/20220913it-s-all-relative-testing-differential-abundance/","publishdate":"2022-12-12T15:23:57-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220913it-s-all-relative-testing-differential-abundance/","section":"webinar","summary":"DFCI Frontiers in Biostatistics Seminar Series\n","tags":[],"title":"It’s All Relative – Testing Differential Abundance in Compositional Microbiome Data","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Introduction to Non-inferiority Designs Important Designs Considerations for Non-inferiority Designs Sample Size Determination for Non-inferiority Designs ","date":1663059600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663059600,"objectID":"77be2b7624d4ca2de112917acbcb474a","permalink":"/webinar/20220913nquery-webinar-sample-size-for-non-inferiority-studies/","publishdate":"2022-12-12T15:21:03-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220913nquery-webinar-sample-size-for-non-inferiority-studies/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"nQuery Webinar: Sample Size for Non-Inferiority Studies","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1662940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662940800,"objectID":"6866d4ca155211a4d9dfd1291c7303b0","permalink":"/conference/20220912royal-statistical-society-rss-international-conference-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-13T10:05:38-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220912royal-statistical-society-rss-international-conference-2022/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Royal Statistical Society (RSS) International Conference 2022","type":"conference"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1662854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662854400,"objectID":"13b702a7a659bc92ad3aa7e19721bd00","permalink":"/conference/20220911society-for-clinical-data-management-scdm-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-13T10:04:15-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220911society-for-clinical-data-management-scdm-2022/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Society for Clinical Data Management (SCDM) 2022","type":"conference"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1662739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662739200,"objectID":"89c886240b40811d0811341e602fd750","permalink":"/webinar/20220909fda-public-webinar/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T10:01:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220909fda-public-webinar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"FDA Public Webinar on Draft Guidance: Patient-Focused Drug Development: Selecting, Developing, or Modifying Fit-For-Purpose Clinical Outcome Assessments","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"  Luo, J, Ruberg, SJ, Qu, Y.

Their implementation can largely be thought of as codifying ‘good standard practice’ for interpreting and reporting classical p-values. Second-generation p-values maintain the favorable properties of classical p-values while emphasizing scientific relevance to expand their utility, functionality, and applicability. In particular, they can report evidence in favor of the alternative, in favor of the null hypothesis, or neither (inconclusive); they automatically incorporate an adjustment for multiple comparisons and multiple looks; they have lower false discovery rates than classical p-values; and they are easier to interpret. Second-generation p-values have been shown to work well in regularized models. They also lead to significantly improved model selection procedures in linear and generalized linear models. Also, second-generation p-values are non-denominational in the sense that they are readily applied in frequentist, likelihood and Bayesian settings.\nOutline and Objectives:\nThis course will briefly revisit the history of p-values as originally envisioned in significance and hypothesis testing, and the resulting controversy over their scientific interpretation. The importance of distinguishing between three key inferential quantities (the measure of the strength of evidence, design error rates, and false discovery rates for observed data) will be illustrated. The second-generation p-value will be introduced and contrasted with standard methods. The workshop will explain how to design studies in which the second-generation p-value is used as the primary mode of inference. We will cover computation of second-generation p-values (in R), guidelines for presenting results, and when appropriate, how to present accompanying false discovery rates. Multiple examples will be presented using data from clinical trials, observations studies and high-dimensional analysis of large-scale data. Advanced applications in model selection, adaptive monitoring of clinical trials, and regularized models will be shown if time allows. Mathematical details will be kept to a minimum, e.g., statistical properties will be presented but without mathematical proof.\n","date":1662022800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662022800,"objectID":"51fbdd5afb0de6e60b79ddbdfb05d5ce","permalink":"/course/20220901asa-traveling-short-course/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T10:38:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20220901asa-traveling-short-course/","section":"course","summary":"Early registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":[],"title":"ASA Traveling Short Course (Hosted by Sacramento Chapter): An Introduction to Second-Generation p-Values and Their Use in Statistical Practice","type":"course"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a mathematical framework to develop intelligent agents that can learn the optimal behaviour that maximizes the cumulative reward by interacting with the environment. There are numerous successful applications in many fields. Statistics and optimization are becoming important tools for RL. In this talk, we will look at two of our recent developments. In the first example, we employ distributional RL for efficient exploration. In distributional RL, the estimated distribution of value function models both the parametric and intrinsic uncertainties. We propose a novel and efficient exploration method for deep RL that has two components: a decaying schedule to suppress the intrinsic uncertainty and an exploration bonus calculated from the upper quantiles of the learned distribution. In the second example, we study damped Anderson mixing for deep RL. Anderson mixing has been heuristically applied to RL algorithms for accelerating convergence and improving the sampling efficiency of deep RL. Motivated by that, we provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the benefits of Anderson mixing in RL. Our main results establish a connection between Anderson mixing and quasi-Newton methods, prove that Anderson mixing increases the convergence radius of policy iteration schemes by an extra contraction factor, and propose a stabilization strategy.

Merging the exploratory (phase II) and the confirmatory (phase III) phases into a single trial and/or a single protocol is regarded as a way to accelerate approval.\nTraditionally, group-sequential designs have an established role in randomized trials and allow for safety monitoring as well as early decisions regarding efficacy and futility of the new treatment in phase III studies. More recently, adaptive designs that enable implementation of modifications to key components of the trial design (targeted treatment effect/sample size, treatment groups, population selection) have become popular despite that they require advanced statistical input and come with additional logistical burden.\nDuring this webinar, a Sponsor and a Statistician will:\n Debate about the distinctive features of these approaches, the applicable regulations, the pros and cons of the various approaches. Address methodological questions such as: what does operationally seamless phase II/III mean? What is the difference between a phase II/III and a phase III trial with interim stopping rules? Do all phase II/III studies use an adaptive design? Discuss the information that is accessible to the Sponsor at the end of the phase II and logistical implications of the various approaches. Discuss and illustrate the regulators’ views.  KEY TAKEAWAYS\nDuring this webinar, the participant will:\n Be exposed to the concepts of operationally and inferentially seamless designs, adaptive designs and group-sequential designs Gain insights into the regulatory and operational aspects of such designs Understand the benefits and limitations of various time-saving clinical study designs in relation to information available at the time of study conception ","date":1655974800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655974800,"objectID":"93a711db1ecb7227033b5633a7427c5a","permalink":"/webinar/20220623iddi-webinar-conversation-between-a-sponsor-and-a-statistician-about-phase-ii-iii-trials-in-oncology/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T09:47:34-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220623iddi-webinar-conversation-between-a-sponsor-and-a-statistician-about-phase-ii-iii-trials-in-oncology/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IDDI Webinar: Conversation between a Sponsor and a Statistician about Phase II/III Trials in Oncology","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1655964000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655964000,"objectID":"fd45f76564302d336f6f4192c893b0ea","permalink":"/webinar/20220623bbs-registry-studies-and-health-technology/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T09:44:18-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220623bbs-registry-studies-and-health-technology/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Basel Biometric Society (BBS) Virtual Seminar: Registry Studies and Health Technology Assessment (HTA)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Featured Talks:\n  Dr. Been Kim (Google Brain) will explore how to translate artificial intelligence for humans.\n  Dr. Gari Clifford (Emory University) will discuss the use of interpretable machine learning in healthcare and its impact on bias and ethics.\n  Dr. Christian Lebiere (Carnegie Mellon University) will present on cognitive models at the interface of humans and machines.\n  Patrick Hall (bnh.ai and The George Washington University) will share proposed guidelines for the responsible use of explainable machine learning.\n ","date":1655805600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655805600,"objectID":"a4e647f62ec11e1c32092bdfcaa76a10","permalink":"/webinar/20220621nasem-symposium/","publishdate":"2022-06-21T09:46:03-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220621nasem-symposium/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Symposium: Interpretable and Explainable AI and Machine Learning","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"useR! is an annual nonprofit conference organized by R community volunteers and supported by the R Foundation.

For a desired risk stratification, we use Bayes Theorem to determine goals for negative or positive likelihood ratios (NLR, PLR). Goals for specificity (Spec) and sensitivity (Sens) are implied by the NLR and PLR goals, but are less flexible. Because NLR, PLR, Spec, and Sens do not depend on prevalence, goals for them are especially useful for validating tests of low prevalence conditions in moderately-sized case-control studies enriched with subjects having the condition. For comparative diagnostic studies, goals that confer that a test is superior or non-inferior to a comparator are based on approximating risk differences and relative risks by functions of likelihood ratios. Wald confidence intervals are developed to facilitate hypothesis testing. To illustrate, we consider a fetal fibronectin assay for ruling out risk of pre-term birth and two human papillomavirus assays for ruling in cervical cancer. We also provide some examples of how to extract acceptable levels of risk stratification from various guidelines on medical decision making.\n","date":1655406000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655406000,"objectID":"0f664067d7b3884e4d9b79d059e521dd","permalink":"/webinar/20220616asa-san-diego-chapter-professional-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T16:10:31-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220616asa-san-diego-chapter-professional-seminar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA San Diego Chapter Professional Seminar: Determining Classification Accuracy Goals of Diagnostic Tests Based on Risk Stratification","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1655301600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655301600,"objectID":"d9327d79295ec707a7fd94385ed056f7","permalink":"/webinar/20220615dana-farber-cancer-institute-data-science-training-session-biomarkers-in-cancer-research/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T16:07:17-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220615dana-farber-cancer-institute-data-science-training-session-biomarkers-in-cancer-research/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute Data Science Training Session: Biomarkers in Cancer Research","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1655222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655222400,"objectID":"d55619f1b46d45de4d5413a04196a99d","permalink":"/webinar/20220614data-umbrella-webinar-short-stories-of-data-visualization/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T16:05:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220614data-umbrella-webinar-short-stories-of-data-visualization/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Data Umbrella Webinar: Short Stories of Data Visualization","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: April 15, 2022\n","date":1655164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655164800,"objectID":"9e644d32ecb300d79a793a86785c3681","permalink":"/conference/20220614quality-and-productivity-research-conference-qprc-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T18:01:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220614quality-and-productivity-research-conference-qprc-2022/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: April 15, 2022\n","tags":[],"title":"The 38th Quality and Productivity Research Conference (QPRC-2022): Data, Statistics and Responsibility","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: March 25, 2022\n","date":1654992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654992000,"objectID":"cd0f8c6f90229d0ca8a533002325acf3","permalink":"/conference/20220612psi-2022-conference/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T20:37:50-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220612psi-2022-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: March 25, 2022\n","tags":[],"title":"PSI 2022 Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654891200,"objectID":"d463b1e36d82b21e9a9c8b95f0892966","permalink":"/webinar/20220610asa-san-francisco-bay-area-chapter-virtual-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T15:47:13-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220610asa-san-francisco-bay-area-chapter-virtual-seminar/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA San Francisco Bay Area Chapter Virtual Seminar: Presentations by Student Travel Award","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Registration fee: WNAR member: $50; Non-member: $150\n","date":1654819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654819200,"objectID":"1e1468b9642953ac4c0412f9f5a0996f","permalink":"/conference/202206102022-wnar-meeting/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T20:45:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/202206102022-wnar-meeting/","section":"conference","summary":"Registration fee: WNAR member: $50; Non-member: $150\n","tags":[],"title":"2022 WNAR Meeting","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"June 9th at 7:00am PT: Effect Modifiers In Indirect Treatment Comparisons; Steps To Ensure the Unbiased Identification to Inform Decision Making [replay]\nAndreas Freitag, Associate Director, Research Principal, Health Economics\nJune 16th at 7:00am PT: When and How to Adjust for Effect Modifiers in Population-Adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparisons?

These outcomes combine death and (possibly recurrent) nonfatal events, such as hospitalization, tumor progression, or infection, and are routinely used as the primary efficacy endpoint in modern phase-III clinical trials. The traditional approach to composite outcomes focuses on time to the first event, whichever type it is, using standard univariate survival analysis techniques. Recent years have seen a surge of more sophisticated and versatile methods, attracting the attention of both statisticians and practitioners. Examples of such methods include the win ratio (Pocock et al., 2012) and its various extensions, the restricted mean time in favor of treatment (a generalized restricted mean survival time), the event (or loss) rate ratio while alive, generalized semiparametric proportional odds regression models, and so on. They improve upon the traditional time-to-first-event analysis in (1) proper prioritization of death over nonfatal events; (2) fuller utilization of multiple/recurrent events; (3) clear and interpretable definition of effect-size estimands; and (4) flexible modeling of different outcome types. In the meantime, a number of user-friendly R-packages that implement the aforementioned methodology have become available. This short course will provide a survey of these methodological developments, along with some practical guidance on using the associated R-packages for real data analysis.\n","date":1654704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654704000,"objectID":"66dc6b814745041f440d74be044e6df3","permalink":"/course/20220608asa-short-course-analysis-of-composite-time-to-event-outcomes/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T15:33:38-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20220608asa-short-course-analysis-of-composite-time-to-event-outcomes/","section":"course","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Short Course: Analysis of Composite Time-to-event Outcomes ","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Introduction to Statistical Intervals and Sample Size Sample Size for Confidence Intervals Sample Size for Prediction and Tolerance Intervals Sample Size for Bayesian Credible Intervals ","date":1654617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654617600,"objectID":"e41801813ddd2b12e92f7b7320f5440a","permalink":"/webinar/20220607nquery-seminar-sample-size-for-statistical-intervals/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T15:29:25-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220607nquery-seminar-sample-size-for-statistical-intervals/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"nQuery Seminar: Sample Size for Statistical Intervals ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: April 27, 2022\n","date":1654560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654560000,"objectID":"a1e87904ea2ed8432368a4ac352d27bb","permalink":"/conference/20220607symposium-on-data-science-and-statistics/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T17:38:56-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220607symposium-on-data-science-and-statistics/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: April 27, 2022\n","tags":[],"title":"Symposium on Data Science and Statistics","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: April 30, 2022\n","date":1654518600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654518600,"objectID":"72e1c7ae30fc70c80326d03750e1b1f1","permalink":"/conference/20220606symposium-on-risks-and-opportunities-of-ai-in-clinical-drug-development/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T17:47:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20220606symposium-on-risks-and-opportunities-of-ai-in-clinical-drug-development/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: April 30, 2022\n","tags":[],"title":"Symposium on Risks and Opportunities of AI in Clinical Drug Development","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"ENAR members: $0; IBS members: $65; Non-members: $85\nConfirmatory platform trials are recently gaining popularity in the pharmaceutical industry. Several such trials have been initiated in the past years; many of these (such as GBM Agile and PANCAN Precision Promise) are multi-sponsor trials. In contrast to similar master protocol designs (such as basket trials) which are well-established in earlier phases of clinical development, the use of platform trial designs for confirmatory studies is still subject to some debate.\nIn particular, there is currently no consensus on the importance of type I error control. In the spectrum from strict control of the Familywise-error rate control (FWER) across the entire platform to no type I error control at all, few researchers take the extreme positions, but within this range, opinions vary. Among the alternative concepts, compromises such as population-wise and treatment-wise error rate control have been suggested.\nThis talk will discuss some of these concepts. Subsequently, we will consider how type I error rate control can be guaranteed in platform trials when techniques such as response adaptive randomization or permitting new treatments into an ongoing platform trial are used. It turns out that adaptive design methodology can be adapted to such uses, but a power loss cannot be avoided.\n","date":1654264800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654264800,"objectID":"02835c6de742825cddd78bcfce767a98","permalink":"/webinar/20220603enar-webinar-recent-developments-in-the-analysis-of-adaptive-designs-and-their-relevance-to-platform-trials/","publishdate":"2022-05-25T13:47:50-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220603enar-webinar-recent-developments-in-the-analysis-of-adaptive-designs-and-their-relevance-to-platform-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"ENAR members: $0; IBS members: $65; Non-members: $85\n","tags":[],"title":"ENAR Webinar: Recent Developments in the Analysis of Adaptive Designs and Their Relevance to Platform Trials","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"An increasing number of clinical trials show a successful outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies.

Using hazard ratio (HR) can mistake a purely prognostic biomarker for a predictive one leading to a disheartening possibility of depriving patients of beneficial treatment as demonstrated in the OAK trial. This stems from the illogical issue of HR at population level where marginal HR in the overall population can be larger than those in both subgroups. The subgroup task force within the Oncology Estimand industry-wide working group discussed such issues and proposes the use alternative logic-respecting efficacy estimands such as ratio of medians, ratio and difference of restricted mean survival times and milestone probabilities. These measures are straightforward, easy to interpret and clinically meaningful. More importantly, they will lead to agreement between marginal and conditional efficacy estimates when analyzing real clinical trial data as long as logic-ensuring analysis principle such as Subgroup Mixable Estimation (SME) is followed. Detailed guidance is provided using either parametric or non-parametric approaches.

Second, those based on modeling to provide a good approximation and then potentially use simulation to propagate uncertainty around a target, leading to a basis for decision making. Finally, those based on machine learning that is often used to reduce complex high dimensional problems and provide the basis for prediction.\nWe shall review problems in a drug development setting using a case-study from a psoriatic arthritis drug development program to illustrate the richness and complexity of data collected during clinical development. Next, we shall show how each of the cultures can provide excellent solutions to certain problems. However, with increased use of data from a variety of sources, there is often a need to combine these three cultures to bring an appropriate solution to a problem. To illustrate this, we shall look at a class of problems where two treatments or options need to be compared but a randomized experiment is not possible. We shall review solutions that combine machine learning, statistical inference and potentially modeling. In addition, we shall review the problem of identifying prognostic and predictive factors using the knockoff approach, which combines control of operating characteristics with realistically complex modeling.\n","date":1653066000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653066000,"objectID":"124eb5bc985247c2fcb8db20f2f20cc3","permalink":"/webinar/20220520combining-the-three-cultures-of-quantitative-decision-making-in-drug-development/","publishdate":"2022-03-29T18:51:47-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220520combining-the-three-cultures-of-quantitative-decision-making-in-drug-development/","section":"webinar","summary":"ENAR members: free; Non-members: $85\n","tags":[],"title":"Combining the Three Cultures of Quantitative Decision Making in Drug Development","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\u0026ldquo;Regression diagnostics\u0026rdquo; are methods for determining whether a regression model fit to data adequately represents the data.

Estimands are systematic because the E9 addendum offers a structured approach and language to precisely describe the treatment effect of interest. Finally, estimates are collaborative because clinicians and statisticians need to work closely together to describe a treatment effect of interest that is clinically meaningful and can be estimated robustly and with minimal assumptions at trial end.

For the former, the stratification factors are typically categorical baseline covariates (region, age group, ECOG status, etc.) that are presumed to influence the clinical endpoint of interest. We caution that uncertainty at the trial design stage can contribute to \u0026ldquo;ineffective\u0026rdquo; stratification and the corresponding stratified analysis can lead to an adversely biased or imprecisely estimated treatment effect, especially for trials designed to assess whether a test treatment prolongs survival relative to a control treatment. To mitigate this non-trivial risk, we show how “effective” stratification can be achieved using a pre-specified treatment-blinded algorithm applied to the clinical trial outcomes, followed by a power-boosting stratified analysis after treatment unblinding. We illustrate the utility of our proposed ‘5-STAR’ approach relative to current practice using a graphical summary of p-values and hazard ratio estimates from 23 real data examples. We also discuss alignment of our novel proposal with FDA guidance on covariate-adjusted analyses, and with related publications by John Tukey, Stuart Pocock, and others.

At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \u0026ldquo;faster\u0026rdquo; make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step.\nOver the dozen+ years since its initial release, the Rcpp package has become the most-widely used language extension for the R system. By our calculations, almost a quarter (23.5%) of CRAN packages use compiled code.

Estimands are a way of clarifying the treatment effect of interest, and can be used to (i) ensure the question being addressed is clear and clinically relevant; and (ii) ensure the trial is appropriately designed and analysed to answer the question of interest. In this talk I will describe the estimands framework, including: (a) what estimands are; (b) how investigators can choose appropriate estimands for their own trials; and (c) how estimands can be used to guide choices on trial design and analysis strategies.\nDr Kaspar Rufibach (Roche)\nMore on the oncology estimand WG: http://www.oncoestimand.org\nMore on Kaspar: http://www.kasparrufibach.ch\nTitle/Abstract: ICH E9 estimands addendum: Old wine in new bottles or a genuine step forward?\nIn this talk I will introduce the ICH E9(R1) estimand addendum and how it helps clarifying scientific objectives in clinical trials (https://www.ich.org/). Using real hematology trial examples I will discuss how the estimand framework helps to design trials with complex treatment options such as potential curative procedures or treatment sequence across different phases. If time permits I will also illustrate how the framework helped clarify whether and how clinical trials might need to be adapted in reaction to the Covid pandemic.\nProf Stijn Vansteelandt (LSHTM/Ghent University)\nTitle: Adopting the estimand framework: be greedy, but not too ambitious\nThe ICH E9 addendum on estimands is timely and welcome in stimulating data analysts to target simple effect measures, directly linked to the scientific question of interest, as is now mainstream in causal inference.\nThis focus is vastly different from that adopted in the statistical modelling tradition, which instead uses a statistical model (rather than an estimand) as the starting point of a statistical analysis.\nIn the first part of the talk, I will argue that this focus on estimands has the potential to raise the quality of data analyses to another level. It therefore deserves to be more greedily adopted in all data analyses, including those that do not suffer complications due to intercurrent events. I will illustrate this by reconsidering the longstanding problem of whether and how to adjust for baseline covariates in randomised clinical trials.\nI will next caution for one major drawback of the estimand framework: that it enables researchers to target questions about which the data carry little or no information. In the second part of the talk, I will therefore caution for the use of overly ambitious estimands. I will illustrate this with a proposal on how to deal with complications due to rescue treatment in randomised clinical trials.\nReferences:\nHernan MA, Scharfstein D.

Using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations or INLA, it is often possible to obtain accurate and much faster inferences (frequently \u0026gt; 100x faster) by calculating very close approximations for posterior distributions of model parameters.\nIn this talk, we will begin with quick basics Approximate Bayesian Inference, then proceed to building an intuition for INLA from first principles.

All through, no prior expertise is assumed, and the emphasis will be on intuition rather than formulae. We then evaluate the real-world performance of MCMC and INLA on actual (anonymized) clinical trial datasets.

The Covid-19 pandemic has provided a particularly dramatic illustration of the potential value of RWD for advancing medical research as well as the high-risk of bias inherent to many such studies. Using data sources that were not collected for research purposes comes at a cost, and naïve use of these data without considering their complexity and imperfect quality can lead to biased inference. While RWD offer the opportunity to generate timely evidence grounded in real-world populations and clinical practice, issues of information bias and confounding create serious threats to the validity of these studies. The statistician is faced with a quandary: how to effectively utilize RWD to advance research without compromising best practices for principled data analysis. In this talk I will use examples from my research on methods for the analysis of EHR derived-data to illustrate how an understanding of the EHR data generating mechanism can inform selection of appropriate study questions and development and application of statistical methods that minimize the risk of bias. The overarching goal of this presentation is to raise awareness of challenges associated with the analysis of RWD and demonstrate that valid evidence generation can be grounded in an understanding of the scientific context and data generating process.\n","date":1646154000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646154000,"objectID":"9478bbd01e126a991323ba8d580576b8","permalink":"/webinar/20220301dfci-frontiers-in-biostatistics-seminar-considerations-for-extracting-real-world-evidence-from-real-world-data/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T14:49:27-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220301dfci-frontiers-in-biostatistics-seminar-considerations-for-extracting-real-world-evidence-from-real-world-data/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DFCI Frontiers in Biostatistics Seminar: Considerations for Extracting Real-World Evidence from Real-World Data","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"As the single-cell field races to characterize each cell type, state, and behavior, the complexity of the computational analysis approaches the complexity of the biological systems.

For example, individuals who are not vaccinated are partly protected when individuals around them are vaccinated. An established approach to this problem is to define causal effects in populations (e.g., a vaccination program in a village) and then attempt to measure these directly. An alternative approach is to define causal effects in pairs of individuals and estimate them using methods from pairwise survival analysis. This approach is likely to yield results that generalize more easily between populations, and it allows more detailed mechanistic insight into the effects of interventions. These pairwise causal effects can be used as the basis of epidemic models that allow estimation of the causal effect of an intervention in a population. This approach places greater emphasis on the longitudinal study of transmission in close contact groups than has been evident in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nPresenter: Yang Yang\nAbstract:\nUnderstanding transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases from contact-tracing data: Contact-tracing data provide crucial and reliable information for understanding transmissibility, risk drivers and intervention efficacies for newly emerging infectious diseases. Analysis of such data is often challenging mainly due to surveillance bias, missing data and lack of biological understanding, which have been further exacerbated by COVID-19. We examine several of these challenges: (1) diagnostic bias towards symptomatic infections; (2) presymptomatic infectivity, i.e., the latent period is shorter than the incubation period; and (3) reporting bias, where only confirmed cases are reported but uninfected close contacts remain unknown. These issues, if left unaddressed, can lead to erroneous estimation of key epidemiological parameters.

Frequentist designs utilize repeated significance testing or conditional power to make early stopping decisions. The majority of frequentist designs are concerned with controlling the overall type I error rate of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis at any analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian designs utilize posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision- making. The prior and threshold values in a Bayesian design can be chosen to either achieve desirable frequentist operating characteristics or reflect the investigator’s subjective belief. We also comment on the likelihood principle, which is commonly tied with statistical inference and decision-making in sequential clinical trials.

CTPs were developed to provide a multiple testing framework that ensures strong control of the type 1 error rate. Many of the most common methods used when evaluating multiple endpoints in clinical trials (e.g., Holms, Hochberg, Hommel, graphical methods etc.) can be recast as CTPs. In this talk I attempt to make the closure principle more tangible by using a new algebra-based formulation of the closed testing framework. This approach attempts to ensure that each step in the derivations and proofs clearly follows from the previous steps. Through this approach, we build toward a better understanding of the versatility and usefulness of the foundational principle underlying all CTPs. We provide a framework for understanding how the closure principle controls the type 1 error rate and what we believe to be an accessible proof of how the closure principle strongly controls the family-wise error rate.\n","date":1644001200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644001200,"objectID":"2e5415d7f4cbbca17eecfadfb54cfad8","permalink":"/webinar/20220204sfasa-virtual-seminar-a-new-framework-for-understanding-the-closed-testing-procedures-with-proof-and-an-example/","publishdate":"2022-01-21T10:31:49-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220204sfasa-virtual-seminar-a-new-framework-for-understanding-the-closed-testing-procedures-with-proof-and-an-example/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SFASA Virtual Seminar: A new framework for understanding the closed testing procedures with proof and an example of testing multiple hypotheses in clinical trial design","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this webinar, we will:\n– Present a historical overview of efficacy assessment in early-phase trials\n– Highlight some recent regulatory trends in that respect\n– Discuss the tension between the clinically appealing and statistically sound methods to assess the efficacy of novel treatments in phase 1 trials, single-arm phase 2 trials, and randomized phase 2 trials\n","date":1643914800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643914800,"objectID":"9f944f2f28f367748bedb01c5423a104","permalink":"/webinar/20220203assessing-treatment-efficacy-in-early-phase-oncology-trials/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T10:46:44-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20220203assessing-treatment-efficacy-in-early-phase-oncology-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Treatment Efficacy in Early-Phase Oncology Trials","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Classical-textbook-inference assumes that a model that is used for inference is correct and given before the analysis.

Tipping point sensitivity analysis for time-to-event: a case study in belimumab\nIn this presentation I will illustrate one way of implementing a tipping point analysis (TPA) for a time-to-event endpoint to assess the robustness of results to the censoring-at-random assumption. The method is based on multiple imputation and it assumes the hazard rate post-censoring changes. A grid of values reflecting such changes is considered to vary the hazard rate post-censoring independently for each treatment arm. The (experimental, control) pairs of post-censoring hazard rate changes form the TPA scenarios. Within each of the TPA scenarios, participants who are censored are imputed a time to the event of interest and are administratively censored if the imputed time exceeds the length of the follow-up. Results are combined across imputed datasets using Rubin’s rules. Finally, the plausibility of the scenarios where the results tip is discussed.\n2. Practical use of Tipping Point Analysis in regulatory submissions of clinical trials\nThe tipping point analysis (TPA) approach has gained popularity recently as an approach for performing the sensitivity analysis under the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption. This presentation will review why TPA gets popular in clinical trial submissions, its implementation for binary endpoints for time-independent imputation and time-dependent imputation, general procedure of TPA implementation for continuous endpoints, and Interpretation of TPA result based on clinical input.

The Cox regression model has also been commonly used for the association and prediction analysis. While an ideal summary measure for the treatment effect should be model-free to avoid the model misspecification at the analysis, the HR is not such a measure. Indeed, there are very few model-free measures for time to event endpoint. The most popular one is either based on the median failure time or the event rate at a specific time point. Both measures are “local” and cannot catch the short- or long-term survival profile.\nIn the past few years, issues of utilizing HR have been extensively discussed. The validity of the HR estimate depends on a strong model assumption; that is, the ratio of two hazard functions is constant over time. When the proportion hazards assumption is not met, the HR estimate is difficult, if not impossible to interpret. In fact, the parameter for which the empirical HR estimates is not a simple weighted average of the HR over time and it generally depends on the censoring distributions. This is highly undesirable. Moreover, even when the proportional hazards assumption is plausible, the physical/clinical interpretation of a single ratio such as the HR estimate between two groups cannot be easily translated into the clinical utility of a new treatment in the absence of a reference hazard level.\nIn this short course, Tian will illustrate issues of the HR and present an alternative, that is, the t-year mean survival time (restricted mean survival time, RMST). It is the mean event-free time up to a specific time point, say, t-year. The RMST was introduced in the statistical literature in 1949, but has not gotten much attention until recently. Here is the list of the topics we will discuss in this short course.\n Issues of Hazard Ratio (HR) Restricted mean survival time (RMST) Power comparison between RMST-based test and HR-based tests Empirical choice of a truncation time for RMST Study design based on RMST RMST for stratified analysis of survival data RMST to non-inferiority trials RMST to quantify long-term survival benefit RMST to assess duration of response RMST in the presence of competing risks RMST for recurrent event time data ","date":1639155600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639155600,"objectID":"468e30a9148c6196b9248ef703e632b3","permalink":"/course/20211210survival-analysis-based-on-the-restricted-mean-survival-time-an-alternative-to-the-proportional-hazards-model/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T09:29:45-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20211210survival-analysis-based-on-the-restricted-mean-survival-time-an-alternative-to-the-proportional-hazards-model/","section":"course","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Survival Analysis Based on the Restricted Mean Survival Time – An Alternative to the Proportional Hazards Model","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"DIA Innovative Design Scientific Working Group (IDSWG) KOL Lecture\n","date":1639148400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639148400,"objectID":"7ef56f3cd35fb63ad36d0f0263a43307","permalink":"/webinar/20211210an-adaptive-flavored-group-sequential-design-with-connection-to-conditional-error/","publishdate":"2021-12-19T11:57:33-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211210an-adaptive-flavored-group-sequential-design-with-connection-to-conditional-error/","section":"webinar","summary":"DIA Innovative Design Scientific Working Group (IDSWG) KOL Lecture\n","tags":[],"title":"An Adaptive-Flavored Group Sequential Design with Connection to Conditional Error","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"ASA Philadelphia Chapter Webinar\nCount data plays an important role in biomedical and clinical research, especially nowadays with the rapid biomedical technique progresses including next generation sequencing. However, using routine statistical model to analyze counts, such as Poisson model, often results in biased or even misleading conclusions. Primary challenges when applying Poisson model to count data include over-dispersion and zero-inflation, which are commonly encountered in practice. In addition, the repeated measures and incomplete observations in modern clinical trials and survey studies add to complexity. This talk will review these challenges in count data analysis and recent methodology progresses made by the speaker\u0026rsquo;s group.

As diagnostics can be used to develop an individualized treatment plan or predict a toxicity associated with a particular therapeutic, they are intimately associated with the field of personalized medicine. The ability to enhance patient care using personalized medicines has prompted pharmaceutical companies to increase their interest in the targeted therapy space. In fact, over the past 6 years, personalized medicines have represented more than 20 percent of FDA’s newly approved therapeutic molecular entities. Additionally, the diagnostic landscape is changing, with the advent of novel technologies and sequencing methods, and an increased focus on the role of software and novel algorithms.\nAs development accelerates, we can expect a growing need for clarity regarding regulatory submissions. For example, the co-development of a companion diagnostic to identify patients that will benefit from a new innovative treatment may present a regulatory challenge for companies wanting to bring them to market simultaneously via an accelerated approval pathway. Also, the need for rapid development of reliable diagnostics may cause companies to continually turn to regulators about the data necessary for approval.\nAt the NEW 2021 DIA Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine Conference, we will have an open dialogue about the challenges and trends in the development of diagnostics and personalized medicines today. Attendees will receive industry and regulatory perspectives on pathways for approval in the US and globally, the impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes, overcoming challenges in development, lessons learned from the COVID-19 diagnostic experience, and utilizing the patient voice.\n","date":1638921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638921600,"objectID":"9517fe9b6e904fe2fbded22591f1d665","permalink":"/conference/20211208diagnostics-and-personalized-medicine-conference/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T10:55:27-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20211208diagnostics-and-personalized-medicine-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Monte Carlo algorithms have completely revolutionised statistical computation, allowing previously intractable models to be solved easily.

This talk will present some simple dynamic graphical examples to illustrate the workings of MCMC.

Previous methods have been proposed to adjust for either NPH patterns or confounding bias, but no previous work has discussed the simultaneous adjustments for both of them. We proposed a propensity score stratified Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model, which incorporates the propensity score stratification adjustment into the Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model. The proposed method could adjust for both observed confounding bias and NPH patterns, and it is easy to implement and has robust performance in the simulation setting under different

When defining the clinical question of interest, clarity is needed about \u0026lsquo;intercurrent events\u0026rsquo; that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest, such as discontinuation of assigned treatment, use of an additional or alternative treatment and terminal events such as death. The description of an estimand should reflect the clinical question of interest in respect of these intercurrent events, and the Addendum introduces strategies to reflect different questions of interest that might be posed. The choice of strategies can influence how more conventional attributes of a trial are reflected when describing the clinical question, for example the treatments, population or the variable (endpoint) of interest.\nIn this seminar we briefly introduce the estimand framework according to the ICH E9(R1) Addendum and describe various strategies for addressing intercurrent events when defining the clinical question of interest. We then reflect on the experience and lessons learned of implementing the Addendum through an internal cross-functional and cross-divisional working group that encompasses various estimand initiatives. Next, we discuss in detail the hypothetical estimand strategy, where a scenario is envisaged in which the intercurrent event would not occur. The Addendum acknowledges that a wide variety of hypothetical scenarios can be envisaged, but it also clarifies that some scenarios are likely to be of more clinical or regulatory interest than others. We share our experiences and try to provide some guidance on their use in clinical trial practice. Finally, we demonstrate how the estimand framework can usefully be applied to clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to address potential pandemic-related trial disruptions and embed them in the context of study objectives and design elements. We introduce different hypothetical estimand strategies and review various causal inference and missing data methods such as multiple imputation and (augmented) inverse probability weighting for the estimation step. To clarify, we describe the features of a stylized trial in neuroscience, and how it may have been impacted by the pandemic.

Some practical issues ranges from overfitting risks, biases, and confounding of prognostic and predictive effects. Modern methods aim to overcome such potential difficulties while remaining flexible, and offer a structured approach to the problem (aiming to avoid the notorious \u0026lsquo;data dredging\u0026rsquo;). The novel techniques are often tree based and/or penalized regression, i.e., with a machine learning flavour.

The adaptive decision at the interim analysis is commonly made based on the conditional probability of trial success. However, one of the critical challenges for such adaptive designs is immature data for interim decisions, particularly in the targeted subgroup with a limited sample size at the first stage of the trial. In this paper, we improve the interim decision making by incorporating information from surrogate endpoints when estimating conditional power at the interim analysis, by predicting the primary treatment effect based on the observed surrogate endpoint and prior knowledge or historical data about the relationship between endpoints. Modified conditional power is developed for both selecting the patient population to be enrolled after the interim analysis and sample size re-estimation. In the simulation study, our proposed design shows a higher chance to make desirable interim decisions and achieves higher overall power, while controlling the overall type I error. This performance is robust over drift of prior knowledge from the true relationship between two endpoints. We also demonstrate the application of our proposed design in two case studies in oncology and vaccine trials.\n","date":1637067600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637067600,"objectID":"0c8994ec8f0a242a0bb98d3036633d31","permalink":"/webinar/20211116incorporating-short-term-endpoints-for-adaptive-subgroup-enrichment-design-with-sample-size-re-estimation/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T09:13:26-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211116incorporating-short-term-endpoints-for-adaptive-subgroup-enrichment-design-with-sample-size-re-estimation/","section":"webinar","summary":"ASA-BI-NESS Statistics Webinar Series #28\n","tags":[],"title":"Incorporating Short-term Endpoints for Adaptive Subgroup Enrichment Design with Sample Size Re-estimation ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Cytel CMO Webinar Series\n","date":1636988400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636988400,"objectID":"a4ceaa01b00975bd3e75ecd1f4f77ee3","permalink":"/webinar/20211115bayesian-trials-in-drug-development-multidisciplinary-round-table/","publishdate":"2021-12-19T10:53:12-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211115bayesian-trials-in-drug-development-multidisciplinary-round-table/","section":"webinar","summary":"Cytel CMO Webinar Series\n","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Trials in Drug Development: Multidisciplinary Round Table","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1636848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636848000,"objectID":"e01bf1d2a89997d799a3af4a6f01aac7","permalink":"/conference/20211114eac-isba-2021-conference/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T10:44:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20211114eac-isba-2021-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Eastern Asia Chapter of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (EAC-ISBA) 2021 Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of American Statistical Association (SFASA) Virtual Seminar\nMatrix completion is a modern missing data problem where the object of interest is a highdimensional and often low-rank matrix. In this talk, I will discuss the application of weighting methods to deal with non-uniform missingness in matrix completion problems. I will highlight some unique challenges associated with inverse probability weighting (IPW)—a standard weighting approach—under matrix completion settings. Then I will introduce our most recent work on matrix completion under general non-uniform missing structures. We draw insight from covariate-balancing methods developed for treatment effect estimations and break away from the IPW framework. By controlling an upper bound of a novel balancing error, we construct weights that can actively adjust for the non-uniformity in the empirical risk without explicitly modeling the observation probabilities. The recovered matrix based on the proposed weighted empirical risk enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. In particular, the proposed method achieves a stronger guarantee than existing work in terms of the scaling with respect to the observation probabilities, under asymptotically heterogeneous missing settings.\n","date":1636750800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636750800,"objectID":"f8a1995ff1c97de63f6429da32e37722","permalink":"/webinar/20211112combating-non-uniformity-in-matrix-completion-through-weights/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T09:09:54-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211112combating-non-uniformity-in-matrix-completion-through-weights/","section":"webinar","summary":"San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of American Statistical Association (SFASA) Virtual Seminar\n","tags":[],"title":"Combating Non-uniformity in Matrix Completion through Weights ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"ASA Columbus Chapter Fall Speaker Event\n","date":1636745400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636745400,"objectID":"16bc8b50bf572e460827107a83350cb9","permalink":"/webinar/20211112operating-under-uncertainty-disease-surveillance-of-covid-19/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T09:07:32-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211112operating-under-uncertainty-disease-surveillance-of-covid-19/","section":"webinar","summary":"ASA Columbus Chapter Fall Speaker Event\n","tags":[],"title":"Operating under Uncertainty – Disease Surveillance of COVID-19","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1636740000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636740000,"objectID":"cf8d9241e84f687dc4f16455220f0835","permalink":"/webinar/20211112new-england-rare-disease-statistics-nerds-workshop-2021-webinar-series-session-2-master-protocols/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T09:04:02-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211112new-england-rare-disease-statistics-nerds-workshop-2021-webinar-series-session-2-master-protocols/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"2021 NERDS Webinar Series Session #2: Composite Endpoints: Master Protocols ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"National Academies Symposium\nDuring the symposium, speakers will discuss how statistical theory helps build in protections for black box machine learning models, new approaches for making sense of high-dimensional and heterogenous data, novel methods for understanding causality, and future research opportunities in deep learning.\n","date":1636653600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636653600,"objectID":"e740f71a043d707904c446d4c7e01ddb","permalink":"/webinar/20211111mathematical-challenges-for-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T08:55:39-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211111mathematical-challenges-for-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/","section":"webinar","summary":"National Academies Symposium\n","tags":["Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Mathematical Challenges for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The Statistics Former Students Network (SFSN) of Texas A\u0026amp;M University Webinarr\n","date":1636650000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636650000,"objectID":"18370ca810097dbf570b59a711f6d813","permalink":"/webinar/20211111drugs-data-and-me-bayesian-integrative-approaches-to-enable-precision-medicine/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T08:50:30-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211111drugs-data-and-me-bayesian-integrative-approaches-to-enable-precision-medicine/","section":"webinar","summary":"The Statistics Former Students Network (SFSN) of Texas A\u0026amp;M University Webinarr\n","tags":[],"title":"Drugs, Data and Me – Bayesian Integrative Approaches to Enable Precision Medicine ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that stimulates a patient’s immune system to fight cancer.

The objective is to identify the biologically optimal dose, defined as the dose with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. An Emax model is utilized to describe the marginal distribution of the immune response. Conditional on the immune response, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a latent variable approach.

Instead response to treatment, defined as a certain amount of shrinkage in the sum of tumor sizes, is commonly used in Phase Ib and II settings. Despite this common use, definition of response is very challenging, in particular dealing with multiple lesions, determining the cutoff in shrinkage, the time of response assessment, dealing with new lesions and measurement error due to reader-to-reader variability.

The selection of covariates may depend crucially on the specific form of the chosen conditional hazard model, which is often assumed to be PH, accelerated failure time (AFT), or proportional odds (PO). However, through empirical and theoretical examples show that none of these semiparametric models allow for the crossing of the survival functions and hence such strong assumptions may adversely affect the selection of variables. Moreover, the most commonly used PH assumption may also be violated when there is a delayed effect of the risk factors. A sequence of Bernstein polynomials based model is instead presented which provides (i) a smooth estimator of the conditional hazard function and is shown to be a unique solution of a strictly convex optimization problem; making it computationally attractive, (ii) a model that encompasses PH structure, and (iii) large sample properties including consistency and convergence rates established under a set of mild regularity conditions. Empirical results based on several simulated data scenarios indicate that the superior performances of the model and thereby shown to avoid possible hazards of the proportional hazard like assumptions.\n","date":1634313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634313600,"objectID":"a366c6767b59e9abf4b6813c2333a4f8","permalink":"/webinar/20211015possible-hazards-of-proportional-hazards-models/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T12:00:51-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20211015possible-hazards-of-proportional-hazards-models/","section":"webinar","summary":"ASA North Carolina Chapter Webinar\n","tags":["survival"],"title":"Possible Hazards of Proportional Hazards Models","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1634256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634256000,"objectID":"817c2da0c04afc5e5bdcaa3b21f38d1b","permalink":"/conference/20211015mlconf2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T10:01:33-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20211015mlconf2021/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"MLconf2021","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Early registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","date":1634169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634169600,"objectID":"968768a492dc31b6e80ce07d7d13b2c3","permalink":"/conference/20211014emerging-data-science-methods-for-complex-biomedical-and-cyber-data-workshop/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T09:52:05-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20211014emerging-data-science-methods-for-complex-biomedical-and-cyber-data-workshop/","section":"conference","summary":"Early registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":[],"title":"Emerging Data Science Methods for Complex Biomedical and Cyber Data Workshop","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Repeated measures of patients through time and other clustered data are common in randomised clinical trials and associated observational studies. Measurements taken from the same patient (or from the same cluster) are likely to be correlated, so that the assumption that all responses will be identically distributed and independent from each other will not hold. Ignoring within-cluster correlation will result in bias in the estimate of the treatment effect standard error and therefore, incorrect confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In some situations it can also result in bias in the treatment estimate itself. Using a range of worked examples, this course will explain how to analyse repeated measures and other clustered data, with an emphasis on estimating treatment effects using the appropriate covariance structure between measurements.\nThis course is presented through recorded lectures and online practical sessions using SAS code.

While clinical trials require appropriate design considerations and pre-specification of analytic methods, interim monitoring of study recruitment, retention, safety, and efficacy are essential to preserve trial integrity. To this end, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC, also referred to as a Data Safety Monitoring Board/Committee, DSMB/DSMC) typically comprised of 3-5 experts, including clinicians and a (bio)statistician, serves to safeguard trial participants, assess benefit-to-risk, and provide recommendations to the sponsor (e.g., pharmaceutical company or government institution) based on accumulating trial data.

However, RCT\u0026rsquo;s are increasingly time consuming, expensive, and laborious with a multitude of bottlenecks involving volunteer recruitment, patient truancy, and adverse events. An alternative that fast tracks clinical trials without compromising quality of scientific results is desirable to more rapidly bring therapies to consumers. We propose a model-based approach using nonparametric Bayesian common atoms models for patient baseline covariates. This specific class of models has two critical advantages in this context: (i) The models have full prior support, i.e., allow to approximate arbitrary distributions without unreasonable restrictions or shrinkage in specific parametric families; (ii) inference naturally facilitates a reweighting scheme to achieve equivalent populations. We prove equivalence of the synthetic and other patient cohorts using an independent separate verification. Failure to classify a merged data set using a flexible statistical learning method such as random forests, support vector machines etc. proves equivalence.

However, chance imbalance may still exist in traditional randomized experiments, and are substantial increasing in big data. In this talk, we discuss several new adaptive designs and their advantages. The proposed methods show substantial advantages over the traditional methods in terms of the covariate balance and computational time.\nSince the randomization inevitably uses the covariate information when forming balanced treatment assignments, the validity of classical statistical inference following such randomization is often unclear in literature. We derived the theoretical properties of statistical inference post general covariate-adjusted randomization under the linear model framework. More important, we explicitly unveil the relationship between covariateadjusted designs and inference properties. We apply the proposed general theory to commonly used procedures and compare their performance analytically.

Such designs provide results for multiple complex hypotheses of clinical interest and reduce the cost and timeline of development. There has been increasing interest in adopting master protocols to expedite clinical development programs. Master protocol have the potential to drive tremendous efficiencies in the development of new therapeutics or vaccines. These trials, in general, are more efficient and less costly than to perform trials individually. These efficiencies can be operational and/or statistical in nature. The master protocol is defined as one overarching protocol that would answer multiple questions or hypotheses. It includes a wide variety of designs with one potential treatment and different disease/population (basket design), multiple potential treatment and one disease (umbrella design), and multiple potential treatment along with multiple disease/population (platform design). In addition, master protocols are adaptive to include early stopping for efficacy or futility, sample size adjustment, dropping an arm, changing randomization ratio, and introducing a new treatment arm during trial. Further statistical efficiency can be gained by use of a shared control. In rare or difficult to enroll populations, a master protocol offers the opportunity to steer important new therapies into a standing clinical trials infrastructure, potentially expediting the availability of badly needed new therapies.\nThe short course will provide an overview of the master protocol along with statistical and operational aspects. This will cover methodology, general design framework and strategies, sample size calculation, and necessary steps for protocol implementation. In addition, we will share through case studies on practical points to consider when running master protocols.\nOutline\n Overview of master protocol: definitions, terminology, and general framework Statistical considerations Operational considerations Practical implementation: study protocol, DSMB Case Study Regulatory guidance: US and rest of the world Summary and discussion ","date":1631293200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631293200,"objectID":"339e36916092a1814dde4c8d930d0a87","permalink":"/course/20210910asa-boston-chapter-short-course-master-protocol-in-drug-development-methodology-and-implementation/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T10:32:20-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20210910asa-boston-chapter-short-course-master-protocol-in-drug-development-methodology-and-implementation/","section":"course","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Boston Chapter Short Course: Master Protocol in Drug Development - Methodology and Implementation","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The estimation of causal effects is one of the primary activities of most longitudinal research studies. For example, analysts might want to understand whether a particular substance abuse treatment program is effective for its clients, whether school-based substance prevention actually reduces substance use, whether interventions can improve the quality and efficiency of mental health care, or whether incentives can increase military recruiting or the retention of service members. Controlled experiments are held as the gold standard for estimating such effects. However, experiments are often infeasible for many reasons and only observational data, in which participation in a program or intervention is out of the control of the researchers, are available for analysis.\nThis short course will provide an introduction to causal modeling using the potential outcomes framework and use of propensity score weights in the estimation of causal effects from observational data. The course will also provide step-by-step guidelines on how to estimate and perform diagnostic checks of propensity score weights for evaluations examining the relative effectiveness of two interventions. The course will also discuss methods for assessing the sensitivity of finding to unobserved covariates. Attendees will gain hands on experience estimating propensity score weights, evaluating the quality of those weights, and utilizing the weights for estimating intervention effects. The course can provide demonstrations of available software in R, SAS, Stata and Shiny (as needed) for fitting the models and opportunities for conducting analyses.

It is critical to identify optimal dose and patient populations in early phase of trials thus improving the probability of success in pivotal trials. Given the complex mechanism interacting with immune system and patient heterogeneity, the conventional oncology dose finding design may not serve the purpose. For example, it is questionable to believe the monotone relationship between dose level and safety/efficacy, which will likely result in inappropriate dose selection using designs with monotone assumption. Additionally, considering the immune system pathway, designs ignoring the heterogeneity of the patient populations may provide misleading dose decisions, which could be either unsafe or lead to selection mistakes for targeted population.\nThis seminar will provide a review and discussion of innovative designs for optimal dose determination in I-O and Cell Therapy from the following perspectives\n Dose finding focusing on DLT Dose finding considering late onset toxicity Dose finding in basket trials with borrowing scheme Optimal dose identification design incorporating both safety and efficacy endpoints ","date":1630674000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630674000,"objectID":"54c62a5c551003243691b0875cbefce1","permalink":"/webinar/20210903adaptive-designs-for-optimal-dose-determination-in-i-o-and-cell-therapy/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T09:32:15-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210903adaptive-designs-for-optimal-dose-determination-in-i-o-and-cell-therapy/","section":"webinar","summary":"Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium\n","tags":["Adaptive Designs","Dose Finding","Immuno-Oncology"],"title":"Adaptive Designs for Optimal Dose Determination in I-O and Cell Therapy","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Key Takeaways:\n  Understand what is the current state of healthcare and summarize the main barriers that are slowing down its data transformation\n  Identify the main verticals of value data transformation can provide the healthcare sector\n  Understand the various data science use cases underpinning scalable data transformation in healthcare\n ","date":1630594800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630594800,"objectID":"fb59fbacfca42caff44774f74955a711","permalink":"/webinar/20210902how-data-science-is-transforming-healthcare/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T09:28:47-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210902how-data-science-is-transforming-healthcare/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"How Data Science is Transforming Healthcare ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"5c87347358dee8c8f2ab781cf235ae65","permalink":"/webinar/20210901advancing-the-development-of-pediatric-therapeutics-adept-7-complex-innovative-trial-design/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T09:24:57-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210901advancing-the-development-of-pediatric-therapeutics-adept-7-complex-innovative-trial-design/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Advancing the Development of Pediatric Therapeutics (Adept 7) Complex Innovative Trial Design","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A seminar series from 7:30 to 8:30 am PST on Aug 27th, Sep 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th \n  August 27, Introductory Workshop\nAssociate Professor Arman Sabbaghi - Department of Statistics, Purdue University\n  September 3, Clutter-Free Causal Inference\nProfessor Donald B.

(1) Based on a new self-learning framework, we train the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) segmentation model using a larger quantity of patients (≈1,000, four institutions), with a mix of annotated/unannotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated by combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on unannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model that identifies associated vessels around the pancreas. Our approach makes it technically feasible for robust large-scale PDAC screening from multi-institutional multi-phase partially-annotated CT scans. (2) We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask. Our results are comparable to a multimodality clinical test that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients with cysts. (3) Accurate preoperative prognosis of resectable PDACs for personalized treatment is highly desired in clinical practice. We present a novel deep neural network for the survival prediction of resectable PDAC patients, 3D Contrast-Enhanced Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CE-ConvLSTM), to derive the tumor attenuation signatures from CE-CT imaging studies. Our framework can significantly improve the prediction performances upon existing state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. This deep tumor signature has evidently added values (as a predictive biomarker) to be combined with the existing clinical staging system.\n","date":1629475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629475200,"objectID":"5a2370560f65115d935e558917a40d7d","permalink":"/webinar/20210820in-search-of-effective-and-reproducible-clinical-imaging-biomarkers-for-population-health-and-oncology-applications-of-screening-diagnosis-and-prognosis/","publishdate":"2021-08-10T10:57:53-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210820in-search-of-effective-and-reproducible-clinical-imaging-biomarkers-for-population-health-and-oncology-applications-of-screening-diagnosis-and-prognosis/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dahshu Webinar: In Search of Effective and Reproducible Clinical Imaging Biomarkers for Population Health and Oncology Applications of Screening, Diagnosis and Prognosis","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series \nSelecting a clinically beneficial and safe dose (or doses) is one of the most difficult and consequential decisions in the drug development process.

This is particularly problematic in longitudinal dose-response models, where additional parametric assumptions must be made on the longitudinal trajectory of each dose. This presentation proposes a class of longitudinal dose-response models to be used in the Bayesian model averaging paradigm which can improve trial operating characteristics while maintaining flexibility a priori.

We propose a master-protocol-based, Bayesian phase I/II platform design to co-develop combination (BPCC) therapies in multiple cancers. Under the BPCC design, only a single master protocol is needed, and the drug is evaluated in different cancers in a concurrent or staggered fashion. For each cancer, we jointly model dose-toxicity and -efficacy relationships and employ Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across them for more efficient cancer-specific decision making. To account for the characteristic of targeted or immunotherapy agents that their efficacy may not monotonically increase with the dose, and often plateau at high doses, we use the utility to quantify the risk-benefit tradeoff of the treatment. At each interim, we update the toxicity and efficacy model, as well as the estimate of the utility, based on the observed data across cancers to inform the cancer-specific decision of dose escalation and de-escalation and identify the optimal biological dose for each cancer.

The addendum recognizes that \u0026ldquo;when using the hypothetical strategy, some conditions are likely to be more acceptable for regulatory decision making than others\u0026rdquo;. However, it is still unclear as to what constitutes \u0026ldquo;acceptable hypothetical conditions\u0026rdquo; which could lead to an interpretable treatment effect. Therefore, it is of great interest to have a diverse group of experts take a deep dive into this topic and help shed light on considerations of hypothetical strategies relevant to the clinical question of interest.

In clinical development, RWD and RWE have the potential to improve the planning and execution of clinical trials and create a virtual control arm for a single arm for accelerated approval and label expansion. From the product lifecycle perspective, effective insights gleaned from RWE bring about informative relative benefits of drugs, comparative effectiveness, price optimization, and new indications.

The prevailing theory of infection transmission, that it was via the direct contact with much bigger particles (often called droplets), leading to distancing at 6 feet arose from work by Flugge in 1897 and later theory by Well-Riley. Immediately upon the detection of the virus, Dr. Morawska and other aerosol experts recognized that the virus may be transmitted by much smaller particles than recognized by Flugge, over longer distances (as far as 60 feet and further) and lingering longer in the air.

With the thinking that \u0026ldquo;there is only one true best\u0026rdquo;, the relevance of MCB to this presentation is it led to the Partitioning Principle, which is essential for deriving confidence sets for stepwise tests. Inference based on confidence sets control the directional error rate, inference based on tests of equalities may not.\nThe FDA gave Accelerated Approval to Aduhelm^{TM} (aducanumab) for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease (AD) on 8 June 2021, based on its reduction of beta-amyloid plaque (a surrogate biomarker endpoint). When clinical efficacy of a treatment for the overall population is not shown, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often used to discover SNPs that might predict efficacy in subgroups. In the process of working on GWAS with real data, we came to realization that, if one causal SNP makes its zero-null hypothesis false, then all other zero-null hypotheses are statistically false as well. While the majority of no-association null hypotheses might well be true biologically, statistically they are false (if one is false) in GWAS. I will indeed illustrate this with a causal SNP for the ApoE gene which is involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid plaque in AD. We suggest our confidence interval CE4 approach instead.\nTargeted therapies such as OPDIVO and TECENTRIQ naturally have patient subgroups, already defined by the extent to which the drug target is present or absent in them, subgroups that may derive differential efficacy. An additional danger of testing equality nulls in the presence of subgroups is that the illusory logical relationships among efficacy in subgroups and their mixtures created by exact quality nulls leads to too drastic a stepwise multiplicity reduction, resulting in inflated directional error rates, as I will explain. Instead, Partition Tests, which would be called Confident Direction methods in the language of Tukey, might be safer to use.\n","date":1624548600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624548600,"objectID":"111660cb1a4586de39388cab33202e34","permalink":"/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T21:29:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ISSI Online Seminar Series: Confident Directional Selective Inference, from Multiple Comparisons with the Best to Precision Medicine","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Two-day course on June 24 and July 1; Registration fee: €100\nThe course is an introduction to effectively communicating, to general audiences, complex statistical modelling and estimation related to Covid-19 data.

Regulatory authorities also encourage aggregate review of safety from ongoing clinical trials, specifically to identify potential risks of adverse events of special interest. Sponsors may decide that a blinded review of safety data can meet these needs while also ensuring clinical trial integrity. A Bayesian methodological framework has been developed that leverages historical data of the background rates of events of interest to monitor and detect potential safety signals using blinded data from ongoing clinical trials. This new method is a two‐step Bayesian evaluation of potential safety signals composed of a screening analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis. The blinded safety teams can use these steps to make an informed decision if any events of interest should be escalated for unblinded review.\nTo ease implementation and operationalization of the method, an R package called BDRIBS (Bayesian Detection of potential Risk using Inference on Blinded Safety data) and an associated R-Shiny application have been developed. The R-package and the R-Shiny tool are both publicly available.\nThe first part of the presentation will focus on the methodological development and the second part will feature the BDRIBS R-Shiny application to illustrate visualization and assessment of the events of interest to help in exploration of various scenarios and sensitivity analyses in real‐time.\n","date":1624028400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624028400,"objectID":"9d8673fad12e85e4643a9c08ebbfbf59","permalink":"/webinar/20210618bayesian-detection-of-potential-safety-signal-from-blinded-clinical-trial-data/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T23:44:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210618bayesian-detection-of-potential-safety-signal-from-blinded-clinical-trial-data/","section":"webinar","summary":"The DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series\n","tags":["Bayesian"],"title":"Bayesian Detection of Potential Safety Signal from Blinded Clinical Trial Data","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series\nIn this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden.

The historical split in objectives and responsibilities of the regulators and the HTA bodies can be seen as one of the reasons for the growing evidence gap remaining after the private sector has performed the trials needed to bring their product to the market. Regulators and HTA bodies differ in their recommendations on patient population, comparators and trial endpoints. The confirmatory trials asked by the regulators may not be fit for purpose to perform HTA nor to inform physicians wanting to practice evidence-based medicine. A better alignment of evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers could accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovations.\nAn additional option is to perform the missing comparative effectiveness trial in the post-marketing phase. Most informative to healthcare decision-makers are practice-oriented, also named pragmatic trials. Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator. Practice-oriented trials lead to real-world evidence and have proven to be practice-changing.

Each pair favors treatment (“win”), control (“loss”), or neither. The “net treatment benefit” is the difference between the proportion of wins minus the proportion of losses. Pairwise comparisons can incorporate several outcomes of interest and several thresholds of clinical relevance in the analysis, and as such, they can be used to personalize treatment choices and to assess the benefit/risk of randomized therapeutic interventions in a rigorous yet flexible manner (Buyse 2010).\nThe advantages and limitations of generalized pairwise comparisons will be illustrated using two typical examples:\n  For a single time-to-event endpoint, the net survival benefit is a meaningful measure of treatment effect whether or not hazards are proportional. When a delayed treatment effect is anticipated, for example in immune-oncology trials, the net benefit is appealing because it stresses benefits that are clinically worthwhile on the time scale. The test based on the net survival benefit can also gain power as compared to the traditional logrank test if interest focuses on long-term survival differences (Péron 2016a).\n  Most anticancer treatment have substantial toxicities that may counterbalance treatment benefits. Generalized pairwise comparisons can be used to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments. This will be illustrated using several randomized trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Péron 2016b).\n  References\nBuyse M.

In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this presentation, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on clinical trial case studies.\n","date":1621526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621526400,"objectID":"9b3cd406a094603c148c9095f1f8a41e","permalink":"/webinar/20210520asa-biop-webinar-graphical-approaches-for-the-control-of-generalized-error-rates/","publishdate":"2021-05-23T10:11:58-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210520asa-biop-webinar-graphical-approaches-for-the-control-of-generalized-error-rates/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA BIOP Webinar: Graphical approaches for the control of generalized error rates","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1621468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621468800,"objectID":"0195687db5c7a77525ddb2a3ab7f42fd","permalink":"/conference/20210520international-indian-statistical-association-iisa-2021-conference/","publishdate":"2021-05-05T15:37:26-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210520international-indian-statistical-association-iisa-2021-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"IISA members: \\$12; non-members: \\$25","tags":[],"title":"International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) 2021 Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this talk we\u0026rsquo;ll introduce the Grammar of Graphics, which allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components, and the implementation of this theory in R \u0026ndash; the ggplot2 package.

The labels are marked areas (either rectangles or free-form boundaries) that are attached to a word, e.g. “tumor.” Naturally, only highly qualified professionals are able to provide these labels making the process effortful and expensive.

Not appropriately addressing these issues obstructs true scientific discovery. Herein, we propose a unified Regularized Zero-inflated Mixture Model framework designed for scRNA-seq data (RZiMM-scRNA) to simultaneously detect cell subgroups and identify gene differential expression based on a developed importance score, accounting for both dropouts and batch effects.

Part of the reasons caused such high failure rate could be inefficient trial design and trial monitoring. In this talk, we introduce the concept of dynamic data monitoring (DDM) for ongoing clinical trials. We develop the principles and procedures for dynamically monitoring on-going clinical trials and demonstrate that the accumulative treatment effect can be automatically estimated and continuously accessible over the information time. Building on the adaptive group sequential (AGS) methods, and by taking the advantage of modern eClinical technologies, we developed a clinical trial “radar” system on which the Wald statistics, conditional power, trend, timing for sample size re-estimation, alerting of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility can be automatically displayed. Thus, the trail can be intelligently monitored. Through simulation, we demonstrate the power of DDM in guiding a promising trial to success or detecting a “hopeless” trial to stop. We provide an example of DDM application in the 1st remdesivir trial in Wuhan China.\n","date":1619193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619193600,"objectID":"02ee194f9151f5b0965f3a0da936e488","permalink":"/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T10:01:44-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DahShu Webinar: Dynamic Data Monitoring of Ongoing Clinical Trials","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Virtual courses (exact times TBD)\n23 April: \u0026ldquo;Introduction to causal inference\u0026rdquo; by Rhian Daniel (Cardiff University)\n18 May: \u0026ldquo;Causal machine learning\u0026rdquo; by Stijn Vansteelandt (Ghent University)\nEvents (exact times and ordering of talks for each theme TBD)\n19 May: Theme 1: Methods (propensity score; double robust \u0026amp; semiparametric estimation; machine learning; Bayesian methods; etc), Invited speaker: Edward Kennedy (Carnegie Mellon University)\n26 May: Theme 2: Survival / longitudinal analyses, trials \u0026amp; estimands, Invited speaker: Jessica Young (Harvard Medical School)\n2 July: Theme 3: Mixed topics - including e.g., applications, designs (IVs etc), interference, econometrics, Invited speaker: Ingeborg Waernbaum (Uppsala University)\n2 September: Theme 4: Foundations, causal DAGs, structural equation models, mediation analysis, Invited speaker: Thomas Richardson (University of Washington)\n","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"3d843eda018ca4e2a837b463c78e97e4","permalink":"/conference/20210423european-causal-inference-meeting-eurocim-2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-29T13:26:56-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210423european-causal-inference-meeting-eurocim-2021/","section":"conference","summary":"Virtual courses on Apr 23 \u0026 May 18.

In this talk, I will review simple and advanced statistical methods for generating polygenic risk score using high-dimensional SNP data and describe theoretical characterizations of their expected performance, both in the population that underlies original studies and in a different population that is expected to have different distribution of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (SNP-correlation).

However, a common practice that naively searches the subgroup with a high treatment level is often misleading due to the “subgroup selection bias.” More importantly, the nature of high-dimensional observational data has further exacerbated the challenge of accurately estimating the subgroup treatment effects. To resolve these issues, we provide new inferential tools based on resampling to assess the replicability of post-hoc identified subgroups from observational studies. Through careful theoretical justification and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence intervals and debiased estimates for the selected subgroup treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. We further demonstrate the merit of the proposed methods by analyzing the UK Biobank data.

Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.\n","date":1616166000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616166000,"objectID":"e2abca4c3d7812c447637ba1d2aef409","permalink":"/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","publishdate":"2021-03-16T10:10:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","section":"webinar","summary":"Online Seminar Series on  Mathematical Foundations of Data Science","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The growth of availability and variety of healthcare data sources has provided unique opportunities for data integration and evidence synthesis, which can potentially accelerate knowledge discovery and enable better clinical decision making. However, many practical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, high-dimensionality and heterogeneity across different datasets, remain to be addressed. In this talk, I will introduce several methods for effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data. Our algorithms are able to account for heterogeneity across different datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms, and examples of implementing the algorithms to real-world clinical research networks.\n","date":1615309200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615309200,"objectID":"03c98d7c2cc0c1cb27e3f5548a2d59c7","permalink":"/webinar/20210309distributed-statistical-learning-and-inference-in-ehr-and-other-healthcare-datasets/","publishdate":"2021-05-12T10:08:25-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210309distributed-statistical-learning-and-inference-in-ehr-and-other-healthcare-datasets/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Real-World Evidence"],"title":"Distributed Statistical Learning and Inference in EHR and Other Healthcare Datasets","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning.

In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the \u0026ldquo;dangers\u0026rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.\nIn this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.\n","date":1614360600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614360600,"objectID":"0c52ea2e23a6a0e1e84751b5e37050f3","permalink":"/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:47:29-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["WNAR"],"title":"Veridical Data Science for biomedical discovery: detecting epistatic interactions with epiTree","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Career Development"],"content":"","date":1614297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614297600,"objectID":"b2b47349b4687b705949c879a83bb569","permalink":"/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T19:28:27-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Career","PSI"],"title":"The Role of a Statistician","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Machine Learning"],"content":"In this talk, Dr. Wolf will provide an overview of common machine learning methods (e.g. ensemble methods, support vector machines and neural networks) and discuss currently implemented importance measures that provide semi-quantitative measures of associations between variables and outcome.\n","date":1614279600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614279600,"objectID":"49ec9e519d010468db23f37d6d5a7251","permalink":"/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:56:43-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["ASA","SLDS"],"title":"Illuminating the Black Box: Variable Importance Measures for Interpretable Machine Learning","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Conference","Statistics","Data Science"],"content":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"adc6c214d16f63c0191f7a153cacea36","permalink":"/conference/20210217csp/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T21:57:17-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210217csp/","section":"conference","summary":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":["ASA"],"title":"2021 ASA Conference on Statistical Practice","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Learn on history of bias and randomization in oncology clinical trials and how to think about what constitutes persuasive evidence of treatment efficacy and safety.\n","date":1613001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613001600,"objectID":"ca2c4bd77465990599747362b846e00b","permalink":"/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T10:58:52-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Oncology"],"title":"Bias and Randomization 1980 - 2020 - 2060","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Additional recordings\n","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611187200,"objectID":"6643f8f8264103879def84675935845a","permalink":"/conference/20210121rstudio-global-2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T12:21:32-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210121rstudio-global-2021/","section":"conference","summary":"","tags":["R"],"title":"RStudio::global 2021","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Bringing estimands to life through a real case study.

In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.\n  Cluster Randomization\nCluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.\n  hree Armed Trials\nNon-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison. In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.\n ","date":1600214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600214400,"objectID":"c6d93f230683fd76a68f83e002ae149e","permalink":"/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:43:21-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Extending A Trial’s Design – Case Studies of Dealing with Study Design Issues","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Two papers were discussed:\n  Sebastian Häckl, Armin Koch \u0026amp; Florian Lasch, Empirical evaluation of the implementation of the EMA guideline on missing data in confirmatory clinical trials: Specification of mixed models for longitudinal data in study protocols, Pharmaceutical Statistics, 2019; volume 18, Issue 6, Pages 636-644.\n  Mutamba T.

In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.\n","date":1598572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598572800,"objectID":"9e5917d65f5d57a1d9bad2f984e170a5","permalink":"/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:20:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["RNA-seq"],"title":"Demystifying “Drop-Out” in Single Cell RNA-seq","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"  August 28, Intuitive Introduction to Deep Learning, Professor Lawrence Carin, Video\n  September 4, Distributed Machine Learning, Professor Heng Huang, Video\n  September 11, A Representational Model of Grid Cells Based on Matrix Lie Algebras, Professor Ying Nian Wu, Video\n  September 18, Integrating Domain-Knowledge into Deep Learning, Professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Video\n ","date":1598572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598572800,"objectID":"630d66ca387af6833a611151597ae2e2","permalink":"/webinar/20200828purdue-university-deep-learning-methods-and-theory-webinar-series/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:29:27-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200828purdue-university-deep-learning-methods-and-theory-webinar-series/","section":"webinar","summary":"Replay links available inside post","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Purdue University: Deep Learning Methods and Theory Webinar Series","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"","date":1598486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598486400,"objectID":"3e8afc3e232dfa21de686dc14707299f","permalink":"/webinar/20200827scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:20:04-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200827scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-2/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scaling Data Science at Your Organization (Part 2)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”?

In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.\n","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"241eba1bc389b177160e98424edd073d","permalink":"/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:13:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Causal Inference"],"title":"Almost Matching Exactly","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"IPTOP framework (Infrastructure, People, Tools, Organization and Processes) for building data strategies and systematically scaling data science within an organization\n","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"12ca65561671e7d285e76b2c8900bea7","permalink":"/webinar/20200820scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-1/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:17:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200820scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-1/","section":"webinar","summary":"IPTOP framework (Infrastructure, People, Tools, Organization and Processes) for building data strategies and systematically scaling data science within an organization\n","tags":[],"title":"Scaling Data Science at Your Organization (Part 1)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597795200,"objectID":"bd6efc62824804f3cf87d1582fd3b167","permalink":"/webinar/20200819duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:15:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200819duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-2/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Duke-Margolis: Data Sharing to Accelerate Therapeutic Development for Rare Diseases (Day 2)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":" Important aspects of Phase II trials designs to consider Practical worked examples of MCP-Mod (continuous outcome) MCP-Mod (binary outcome) Fleming GST (binary outcome) ","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597708800,"objectID":"eae9ac0b5ce93b2d8c68710d350542b0","permalink":"/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:11:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs"],"title":"Adaptive Designs for Phase II Clinical Trials ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597708800,"objectID":"8e26ccee411cc3eb1f2db09f91fce272","permalink":"/webinar/20200818duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-1/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:13:55-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200818duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-1/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Duke-Margolis: Data Sharing to Accelerate Therapeutic Development for Rare Diseases (Day 1)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this webinar, I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0.

Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.\nWe explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.\n","date":1594944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594944000,"objectID":"1adb96d3cf2276cf7faf3f914cd23e24","permalink":"/webinar/20200717dahshu/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T15:04:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200717dahshu/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["causal effects","health outcome","experimental design"],"title":"Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":" The use of the estimand framework to assess and address pandemic-related disruptions Analysis strategies for pandemic-related missing and unobservable values ","date":1594911600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594911600,"objectID":"a6677d031645570f9752135ab9a0215b","permalink":"/webinar/20200716estimands-and-analysis-considerations-for-clinical-trials-impacted-by-covid-19/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:34:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200716estimands-and-analysis-considerations-for-clinical-trials-impacted-by-covid-19/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["COVID-19","Estimand","DIA"],"title":"Estimands and Analysis Considerations for Clinical Trials Impacted by COVID-19","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"","date":1594825200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594825200,"objectID":"becc88b7cd43e51c6a768129b051c396","permalink":"/webinar/20200715introduction-to-population-enrichment-trial-designs/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:26:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200715introduction-to-population-enrichment-trial-designs/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs"],"title":"Introduction to Population Enrichment Trial Designs","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"4 key learnings attendees will take away from this webinar:\n The value of good design of experiments Consider Bayesian statistics to answer your question P-values is not always what you’re looking for Adopt a life-cycle over the long-run, not just study by study ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"6a8c669d3b69740848cc6038efd5dc81","permalink":"/webinar/20200715good-statistical-practices-to-tackle-the-lack-of-reproducibility-in-preclinical-research/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T10:30:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200715good-statistical-practices-to-tackle-the-lack-of-reproducibility-in-preclinical-research/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Preclinical","PSI","Toxicology","Reproducibility"],"title":"Good Statistical Practices to Tackle the Lack of Reproducibility in Preclinical Research","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications.
