While those actions have an indirect benefit for the patient, to truly help them and their healthcare practitioners it is necessary to go beyond the raw data and translate the information into the benefit to risk context, informing risk management plans and specific mitigation actions that are derived from data. The goal of pharmacovigilance should be to minimize pain and suffering in patients who strive to benefit from the medicine prescribed by their physician. By properly characterizing benefits and risks of medicines in appropriate populations and semi-quantitatively or quantitatively estimating whether and to which extent the benefits outweigh the risks one can create tangible context for regulators, prescribers, and patients. This informs specific action plans for the health care provider to optimize the use of the treatment ensuring the right medicine gets to right patient.

Such designs provide results for multiple complex hypotheses of clinical interest and reduce the cost and timeline of development. There has been increasing interest in adopting master protocols to expedite clinical development programs. Master protocol have the potential to drive tremendous efficiencies in the development of new therapeutics or vaccines. These trials, in general, are more efficient and less costly than to perform trials individually. These efficiencies can be operational and/or statistical in nature. The master protocol is defined as one overarching protocol that would answer multiple questions or hypotheses. It includes a wide variety of designs with one potential treatment and different disease/population (basket design), multiple potential treatment and one disease (umbrella design), and multiple potential treatment along with multiple disease/population (platform design). In addition, master protocols are adaptive to include early stopping for efficacy or futility, sample size adjustment, dropping an arm, changing randomization ratio, and introducing a new treatment arm during trial. Further statistical efficiency can be gained by use of a shared control. In rare or difficult to enroll populations, a master protocol offers the opportunity to steer important new therapies into a standing clinical trials infrastructure, potentially expediting the availability of badly needed new therapies.\nThe short course will provide an overview of the master protocol along with statistical and operational aspects. This will cover methodology, general design framework and strategies, sample size calculation, and necessary steps for protocol implementation. In addition, we will share through case studies on practical points to consider when running master protocols.\nOutline\n Overview of master protocol: definitions, terminology, and general framework Statistical considerations Operational considerations Practical implementation: study protocol, DSMB Case Study Regulatory guidance: US and rest of the world Summary and discussion ","date":1631293200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631293200,"objectID":"339e36916092a1814dde4c8d930d0a87","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20210910asa-boston-chapter-short-course-master-protocol-in-drug-development-methodology-and-implementation/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T10:32:20-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20210910asa-boston-chapter-short-course-master-protocol-in-drug-development-methodology-and-implementation/","section":"course","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Boston Chapter Short Course: Master Protocol in Drug Development - Methodology and Implementation","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The estimation of causal effects is one of the primary activities of most longitudinal research studies. For example, analysts might want to understand whether a particular substance abuse treatment program is effective for its clients, whether school-based substance prevention actually reduces substance use, whether interventions can improve the quality and efficiency of mental health care, or whether incentives can increase military recruiting or the retention of service members. Controlled experiments are held as the gold standard for estimating such effects. However, experiments are often infeasible for many reasons and only observational data, in which participation in a program or intervention is out of the control of the researchers, are available for analysis.\nThis short course will provide an introduction to causal modeling using the potential outcomes framework and use of propensity score weights in the estimation of causal effects from observational data. The course will also provide step-by-step guidelines on how to estimate and perform diagnostic checks of propensity score weights for evaluations examining the relative effectiveness of two interventions. The course will also discuss methods for assessing the sensitivity of finding to unobserved covariates. Attendees will gain hands on experience estimating propensity score weights, evaluating the quality of those weights, and utilizing the weights for estimating intervention effects. The course can provide demonstrations of available software in R, SAS, Stata and Shiny (as needed) for fitting the models and opportunities for conducting analyses. The primary goals of the course are for attendees to have an understanding of how to implement propensity score weighting using state-of-art-methods and insights into some of the practical issues that evaluating the quality of propensity score weights involve.\n","date":1631278800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631278800,"objectID":"c8c8d30aa49b24c4dc44abf939f65daf","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20210910asa-traveling-course-hosted-by-connecticut-chapter-causal-inferences/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T10:26:39-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20210910asa-traveling-course-hosted-by-connecticut-chapter-causal-inferences/","section":"course","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA Traveling Course (Hosted by Connecticut Chapter): Guidelines for using State-of-the-Art Methods to Estimate Propensity Score and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights When Drawing Causal Inferences ","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"September 8 and 9, 2021, 6:00-9:00am PST \n","date":1631059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631059200,"objectID":"fcaaf019ed943e6072e834e87827ed70","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/course/20210908asa-traveling-course-central-indiana-chapter-guidelines-to-estimate-propensity-score-and-inverse-probability-of-treatment-weights/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T10:22:03-07:00","relpermalink":"/course/20210908asa-traveling-course-central-indiana-chapter-guidelines-to-estimate-propensity-score-and-inverse-probability-of-treatment-weights/","section":"course","summary":"September 8 and 9, 2021, 6:00-9:00am PST \n","tags":[],"title":"ASA Traveling Course (Hosted by Central Indiana Chapter): Guidelines for using State-of-the-Art Methods to Estimate Propensity Score and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights When Drawing Causal Inferences ","type":"course"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This will be a three-part webinar presentation from 8-10am PST on September 7th, 8th, and 9th.

(1) Based on a new self-learning framework, we train the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) segmentation model using a larger quantity of patients (≈1,000, four institutions), with a mix of annotated/unannotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated by combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on unannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model that identifies associated vessels around the pancreas. Our approach makes it technically feasible for robust large-scale PDAC screening from multi-institutional multi-phase partially-annotated CT scans. (2) We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask. Our results are comparable to a multimodality clinical test that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients with cysts. (3) Accurate preoperative prognosis of resectable PDACs for personalized treatment is highly desired in clinical practice. We present a novel deep neural network for the survival prediction of resectable PDAC patients, 3D Contrast-Enhanced Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CE-ConvLSTM), to derive the tumor attenuation signatures from CE-CT imaging studies. Our framework can significantly improve the prediction performances upon existing state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. This deep tumor signature has evidently added values (as a predictive biomarker) to be combined with the existing clinical staging system.\n","date":1629475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629475200,"objectID":"5a2370560f65115d935e558917a40d7d","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210820in-search-of-effective-and-reproducible-clinical-imaging-biomarkers-for-population-health-and-oncology-applications-of-screening-diagnosis-and-prognosis/","publishdate":"2021-08-10T10:57:53-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210820in-search-of-effective-and-reproducible-clinical-imaging-biomarkers-for-population-health-and-oncology-applications-of-screening-diagnosis-and-prognosis/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dahshu Webinar: In Search of Effective and Reproducible Clinical Imaging Biomarkers for Population Health and Oncology Applications of Screening, Diagnosis and Prognosis","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series \nSelecting a clinically beneficial and safe dose (or doses) is one of the most difficult and consequential decisions in the drug development process. Dose justification often relies on dose-response modeling, but parametric assumptions must be made a priori, often with little information, potentially leading to a situation where the chosen model does not fit the data well. This is particularly problematic in longitudinal dose-response models, where additional parametric assumptions must be made on the longitudinal trajectory of each dose. This presentation proposes a class of longitudinal dose-response models to be used in the Bayesian model averaging paradigm which can improve trial operating characteristics while maintaining flexibility a priori.

We propose a master-protocol-based, Bayesian phase I/II platform design to co-develop combination (BPCC) therapies in multiple cancers. Under the BPCC design, only a single master protocol is needed, and the drug is evaluated in different cancers in a concurrent or staggered fashion. For each cancer, we jointly model dose-toxicity and -efficacy relationships and employ Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across them for more efficient cancer-specific decision making. To account for the characteristic of targeted or immunotherapy agents that their efficacy may not monotonically increase with the dose, and often plateau at high doses, we use the utility to quantify the risk-benefit tradeoff of the treatment. At each interim, we update the toxicity and efficacy model, as well as the estimate of the utility, based on the observed data across cancers to inform the cancer-specific decision of dose escalation and de-escalation and identify the optimal biological dose for each cancer. Simulation study shows that the BPCC design has desirable operating characteristics, and that it provides an efficient approach to accelerate the development of combination therapies.\n","date":1628179200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628179200,"objectID":"f03d3c8fc2fd1b598a968cf4f46df19a","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210805a-bayesian-phase-i-ii-platform-design-for-co-developing-drug-combination-therapies-for-multiple-indications/","publishdate":"2021-07-15T13:29:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210805a-bayesian-phase-i-ii-platform-design-for-co-developing-drug-combination-therapies-for-multiple-indications/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Bayesian","Master Protocol"],"title":"A Bayesian phase I/II platform design for co-developing drug combination therapies for multiple indications","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Nitin will show that Pareto Optimality, a simple and intuitive concept for partial ordering, is very effective in sifting through results of a large number of trial design simulations to identify a set of designs that collectively dominate all other designs for the three criteria of power, cost and duration in an oncology Ph3 trial design.\n","date":1628089200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628089200,"objectID":"f29c340bfbfc3034d5797aba6c79ff3f","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210804applying-operations-research-methods-to-trial-design-selection/","publishdate":"2021-07-19T11:50:07-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210804applying-operations-research-methods-to-trial-design-selection/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Applying Operations Research Methods to Trial Design Selection","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627599600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627599600,"objectID":"196f235299cc73235651e0ea02539397","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210729classifying-brain-tumor-types-by-mri-scans-with-convolutional-neural-network/","publishdate":"2021-07-22T11:13:37-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210729classifying-brain-tumor-types-by-mri-scans-with-convolutional-neural-network/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Classifying Brain Tumor Types by MRI Scans with Convolutional Neural Network","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) will act as the single entry point for clinical trials authorisation and supervision in the EEA.

The addendum recognizes that \u0026ldquo;when using the hypothetical strategy, some conditions are likely to be more acceptable for regulatory decision making than others\u0026rdquo;. However, it is still unclear as to what constitutes \u0026ldquo;acceptable hypothetical conditions\u0026rdquo; which could lead to an interpretable treatment effect. Therefore, it is of great interest to have a diverse group of experts take a deep dive into this topic and help shed light on considerations of hypothetical strategies relevant to the clinical question of interest.

While ML and AI may offer advantages over traditional statistical methods for certain tasks, they tend to use complex algorithms and are often regarded as analytical “black boxes”. Hence these novel methods pose new challenges of statistical literacy for producers and consumers of health research. Such challenges may be compounded by an underlying lack of communication and understanding between the statistics and ML/AI communities. Are statisticians slow to embrace the potential of ML and AI methods, and guilty of trying to protect their role in collaborative research in the face of competition from other fields?

The prevailing theory of infection transmission, that it was via the direct contact with much bigger particles (often called droplets), leading to distancing at 6 feet arose from work by Flugge in 1897 and later theory by Well-Riley. Immediately upon the detection of the virus, Dr. Morawska and other aerosol experts recognized that the virus may be transmitted by much smaller particles than recognized by Flugge, over longer distances (as far as 60 feet and further) and lingering longer in the air. This is a major change in understanding and public health implications of virus transmission. WHO guidance was modified to reflect the possibility of virus transmission over longer distances and lingering longer in the air.

With the thinking that \u0026ldquo;there is only one true best\u0026rdquo;, the relevance of MCB to this presentation is it led to the Partitioning Principle, which is essential for deriving confidence sets for stepwise tests. Inference based on confidence sets control the directional error rate, inference based on tests of equalities may not.\nThe FDA gave Accelerated Approval to Aduhelm^{TM} (aducanumab) for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease (AD) on 8 June 2021, based on its reduction of beta-amyloid plaque (a surrogate biomarker endpoint). When clinical efficacy of a treatment for the overall population is not shown, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often used to discover SNPs that might predict efficacy in subgroups. In the process of working on GWAS with real data, we came to realization that, if one causal SNP makes its zero-null hypothesis false, then all other zero-null hypotheses are statistically false as well. While the majority of no-association null hypotheses might well be true biologically, statistically they are false (if one is false) in GWAS. I will indeed illustrate this with a causal SNP for the ApoE gene which is involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid plaque in AD. We suggest our confidence interval CE4 approach instead.\nTargeted therapies such as OPDIVO and TECENTRIQ naturally have patient subgroups, already defined by the extent to which the drug target is present or absent in them, subgroups that may derive differential efficacy. An additional danger of testing equality nulls in the presence of subgroups is that the illusory logical relationships among efficacy in subgroups and their mixtures created by exact quality nulls leads to too drastic a stepwise multiplicity reduction, resulting in inflated directional error rates, as I will explain. Instead, Partition Tests, which would be called Confident Direction methods in the language of Tukey, might be safer to use.\n","date":1624548600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624548600,"objectID":"111660cb1a4586de39388cab33202e34","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T21:29:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ISSI Online Seminar Series: Confident Directional Selective Inference, from Multiple Comparisons with the Best to Precision Medicine","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Two-day course on June 24 and July 1; Registration fee: €100\nThe course is an introduction to effectively communicating, to general audiences, complex statistical modelling and estimation related to Covid-19 data.

A Bayesian methodological framework has been developed that leverages historical data of the background rates of events of interest to monitor and detect potential safety signals using blinded data from ongoing clinical trials. This new method is a two‐step Bayesian evaluation of potential safety signals composed of a screening analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis. The blinded safety teams can use these steps to make an informed decision if any events of interest should be escalated for unblinded review.\nTo ease implementation and operationalization of the method, an R package called BDRIBS (Bayesian Detection of potential Risk using Inference on Blinded Safety data) and an associated R-Shiny application have been developed. The R-package and the R-Shiny tool are both publicly available.\nThe first part of the presentation will focus on the methodological development and the second part will feature the BDRIBS R-Shiny application to illustrate visualization and assessment of the events of interest to help in exploration of various scenarios and sensitivity analyses in real‐time.\n","date":1624028400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624028400,"objectID":"9d8673fad12e85e4643a9c08ebbfbf59","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210618bayesian-detection-of-potential-safety-signal-from-blinded-clinical-trial-data/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T23:44:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210618bayesian-detection-of-potential-safety-signal-from-blinded-clinical-trial-data/","section":"webinar","summary":"The DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series\n","tags":["Bayesian"],"title":"Bayesian Detection of Potential Safety Signal from Blinded Clinical Trial Data","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series\nIn this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden.

The historical split in objectives and responsibilities of the regulators and the HTA bodies can be seen as one of the reasons for the growing evidence gap remaining after the private sector has performed the trials needed to bring their product to the market. Regulators and HTA bodies differ in their recommendations on patient population, comparators and trial endpoints. The confirmatory trials asked by the regulators may not be fit for purpose to perform HTA nor to inform physicians wanting to practice evidence-based medicine. A better alignment of evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers could accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovations.\nAn additional option is to perform the missing comparative effectiveness trial in the post-marketing phase. Most informative to healthcare decision-makers are practice-oriented, also named pragmatic trials. Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator. Practice-oriented trials lead to real-world evidence and have proven to be practice-changing. A clear pathway towards the realization of such efficient trial methods is needed.\nKEY TAKEWAYS\n Patient access to evidence-based innovations can be accelerated if practice-oriented trials are timely conducted.

Each pair favors treatment (“win”), control (“loss”), or neither. The “net treatment benefit” is the difference between the proportion of wins minus the proportion of losses. Pairwise comparisons can incorporate several outcomes of interest and several thresholds of clinical relevance in the analysis, and as such, they can be used to personalize treatment choices and to assess the benefit/risk of randomized therapeutic interventions in a rigorous yet flexible manner (Buyse 2010).\nThe advantages and limitations of generalized pairwise comparisons will be illustrated using two typical examples:\n  For a single time-to-event endpoint, the net survival benefit is a meaningful measure of treatment effect whether or not hazards are proportional. When a delayed treatment effect is anticipated, for example in immune-oncology trials, the net benefit is appealing because it stresses benefits that are clinically worthwhile on the time scale. The test based on the net survival benefit can also gain power as compared to the traditional logrank test if interest focuses on long-term survival differences (Péron 2016a).\n  Most anticancer treatment have substantial toxicities that may counterbalance treatment benefits. Generalized pairwise comparisons can be used to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments. This will be illustrated using several randomized trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Péron 2016b).\n  References\nBuyse M.

In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this presentation, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on clinical trial case studies.\n","date":1621526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621526400,"objectID":"9b3cd406a094603c148c9095f1f8a41e","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210520asa-biop-webinar-graphical-approaches-for-the-control-of-generalized-error-rates/","publishdate":"2021-05-23T10:11:58-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210520asa-biop-webinar-graphical-approaches-for-the-control-of-generalized-error-rates/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASA BIOP Webinar: Graphical approaches for the control of generalized error rates","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1621468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621468800,"objectID":"0195687db5c7a77525ddb2a3ab7f42fd","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20210520international-indian-statistical-association-iisa-2021-conference/","publishdate":"2021-05-05T15:37:26-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210520international-indian-statistical-association-iisa-2021-conference/","section":"conference","summary":"IISA members: \\$12; non-members: \\$25","tags":[],"title":"International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) 2021 Conference","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this talk we\u0026rsquo;ll introduce the Grammar of Graphics, which allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components, and the implementation of this theory in R \u0026ndash; the ggplot2 package.

Detecting, localizing, and diagnosing diseases and recognizing structures on MRI, CT, PET, XRay, ultrasound and photographic images is efficiently done by AI. What is rarely discussed, is how these AI systems are made. They require copious amounts of training data consisting of images and human-supplied labels. The labels are marked areas (either rectangles or free-form boundaries) that are attached to a word, e.g. “tumor.” Naturally, only highly qualified professionals are able to provide these labels making the process effortful and expensive. A technique called “active learning” from AI can help with this by reducing the manual effort by 90%. This allows the creation of state-of-the-art AI models for medicine using a significantly smaller budget of time and resources.

This new technology provides unprecedented opportunities to study disease heterogeneity at the cellular level. However, unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including large dimensionality, high dropout rates, and possibly batch effects, bring great difficulty into the analysis of such data. Not appropriately addressing these issues obstructs true scientific discovery. Herein, we propose a unified Regularized Zero-inflated Mixture Model framework designed for scRNA-seq data (RZiMM-scRNA) to simultaneously detect cell subgroups and identify gene differential expression based on a developed importance score, accounting for both dropouts and batch effects. We conduct extensive empirical investigation to demonstrate the promise of RZiMM-scRNA in comparison to several popular methods, including K-means and Hierarchical clustering.\n","date":1620752400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620752400,"objectID":"c5620850b6f9b8013597834537194f6a","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210511frontiers-in-biostatistics-seminar-single-cell-rna-seq-data-analysis-via-a-regularized-zero-inflated-mixture-model-framework/","publishdate":"2021-05-05T14:46:29-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210511frontiers-in-biostatistics-seminar-single-cell-rna-seq-data-analysis-via-a-regularized-zero-inflated-mixture-model-framework/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Frontiers in Biostatistics Seminar: Single-cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis Via a Regularized Zero-Inflated Mixture Model Framework","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The conference will feature research topics inspired by the substantial contributions of Professor Barry C.

Part of the reasons caused such high failure rate could be inefficient trial design and trial monitoring. In this talk, we introduce the concept of dynamic data monitoring (DDM) for ongoing clinical trials. We develop the principles and procedures for dynamically monitoring on-going clinical trials and demonstrate that the accumulative treatment effect can be automatically estimated and continuously accessible over the information time. Building on the adaptive group sequential (AGS) methods, and by taking the advantage of modern eClinical technologies, we developed a clinical trial “radar” system on which the Wald statistics, conditional power, trend, timing for sample size re-estimation, alerting of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility can be automatically displayed. Thus, the trail can be intelligently monitored. Through simulation, we demonstrate the power of DDM in guiding a promising trial to success or detecting a “hopeless” trial to stop. We provide an example of DDM application in the 1st remdesivir trial in Wuhan China.\n","date":1619193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619193600,"objectID":"02ee194f9151f5b0965f3a0da936e488","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T10:01:44-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DahShu Webinar: Dynamic Data Monitoring of Ongoing Clinical Trials","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Virtual courses (exact times TBD)\n23 April: \u0026ldquo;Introduction to causal inference\u0026rdquo; by Rhian Daniel (Cardiff University)\n18 May: \u0026ldquo;Causal machine learning\u0026rdquo; by Stijn Vansteelandt (Ghent University)\nEvents (exact times and ordering of talks for each theme TBD)\n19 May: Theme 1: Methods (propensity score; double robust \u0026amp; semiparametric estimation; machine learning; Bayesian methods; etc), Invited speaker: Edward Kennedy (Carnegie Mellon University)\n26 May: Theme 2: Survival / longitudinal analyses, trials \u0026amp; estimands, Invited speaker: Jessica Young (Harvard Medical School)\n2 July: Theme 3: Mixed topics - including e.g., applications, designs (IVs etc), interference, econometrics, Invited speaker: Ingeborg Waernbaum (Uppsala University)\n2 September: Theme 4: Foundations, causal DAGs, structural equation models, mediation analysis, Invited speaker: Thomas Richardson (University of Washington)\n","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"3d843eda018ca4e2a837b463c78e97e4","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20210423european-causal-inference-meeting-eurocim-2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-29T13:26:56-07:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210423european-causal-inference-meeting-eurocim-2021/","section":"conference","summary":"Virtual courses on Apr 23 \u0026 May 18.

In this talk, I will review simple and advanced statistical methods for generating polygenic risk score using high-dimensional SNP data and describe theoretical characterizations of their expected performance, both in the population that underlies original studies and in a different population that is expected to have different distribution of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (SNP-correlation). I will further describe novel Bayesian and machine learning based methods for building polygenic risk scores that can borrow information across GWAS studies of different ethnic groups, and thus makes best use of available data to generate more powerful polygenic risk scores across different ethnic groups.

However, a common practice that naively searches the subgroup with a high treatment level is often misleading due to the “subgroup selection bias.” More importantly, the nature of high-dimensional observational data has further exacerbated the challenge of accurately estimating the subgroup treatment effects. To resolve these issues, we provide new inferential tools based on resampling to assess the replicability of post-hoc identified subgroups from observational studies. Through careful theoretical justification and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence intervals and debiased estimates for the selected subgroup treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. We further demonstrate the merit of the proposed methods by analyzing the UK Biobank data. The R package “debiased.subgroup\u0026quot; implementing the proposed procedures is available on

This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions.

Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.\n","date":1616166000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616166000,"objectID":"e2abca4c3d7812c447637ba1d2aef409","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","publishdate":"2021-03-16T10:10:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/","section":"webinar","summary":"Online Seminar Series on  Mathematical Foundations of Data Science","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The growth of availability and variety of healthcare data sources has provided unique opportunities for data integration and evidence synthesis, which can potentially accelerate knowledge discovery and enable better clinical decision making.

In this talk, I will introduce several methods for effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data.

In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the \u0026ldquo;dangers\u0026rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.\nIn this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.\n","date":1614360600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614360600,"objectID":"0c52ea2e23a6a0e1e84751b5e37050f3","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:47:29-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226veridical-data-science-for-biomedical-discovery-detecting-epistatic-interactions-with-epitree/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["WNAR"],"title":"Veridical Data Science for biomedical discovery: detecting epistatic interactions with epiTree","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Career Development"],"content":"","date":1614297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614297600,"objectID":"b2b47349b4687b705949c879a83bb569","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T19:28:27-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210226the-role-of-a-statistician/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Career","PSI"],"title":"The Role of a Statistician","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Machine Learning"],"content":"Recording passcode: 6cleDgX+\nIn this talk, Dr. Wolf will provide an overview of common machine learning methods (e.g. ensemble methods, support vector machines and neural networks) and discuss currently implemented importance measures that provide semi-quantitative measures of associations between variables and outcome.\n","date":1614279600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614279600,"objectID":"49ec9e519d010468db23f37d6d5a7251","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T09:56:43-08:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210225illuminating-the-black-box-variable-importance-measures-for-interpretable-machine-learning/","section":"webinar","summary":"Recording passcode: 6cleDgX+","tags":["ASA","SLDS"],"title":"Illuminating the Black Box: Variable Importance Measures for Interpretable Machine Learning","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Conference","Statistics","Data Science"],"content":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"adc6c214d16f63c0191f7a153cacea36","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/conference/20210217csp/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T21:57:17-08:00","relpermalink":"/conference/20210217csp/","section":"conference","summary":"The goal of the conference is to provide participants with opportunities to learn new statistical methodologies and best practices in statistical analysis, design, consulting, and statistical programming.\nEarly registration Deadline: Jan 11, 2021\n","tags":["ASA"],"title":"2021 ASA Conference on Statistical Practice","type":"conference"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Learn on history of bias and randomization in oncology clinical trials and how to think about what constitutes persuasive evidence of treatment efficacy and safety.\n","date":1613001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613001600,"objectID":"ca2c4bd77465990599747362b846e00b","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T10:58:52-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20210211bias-and-randomization-1980-2020-2060/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Oncology"],"title":"Bias and Randomization 1980 - 2020 - 2060","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Bringing estimands to life through a real case study.

This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.\n  Cluster Randomization\nCluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.\n  hree Armed Trials\nNon-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison. In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.\n ","date":1600214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600214400,"objectID":"c6d93f230683fd76a68f83e002ae149e","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:43:21-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200916extending-a-trial-s-design-case-studies-of-dealing-with-study-design-issues/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Extending A Trial’s Design – Case Studies of Dealing with Study Design Issues","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":"Two papers were discussed:\n  Sebastian Häckl, Armin Koch \u0026amp; Florian Lasch, Empirical evaluation of the implementation of the EMA guideline on missing data in confirmatory clinical trials: Specification of mixed models for longitudinal data in study protocols, Pharmaceutical Statistics, 2019; volume 18, Issue 6, Pages 636-644.\n  Mutamba T.

Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.\n","date":1598572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598572800,"objectID":"9e5917d65f5d57a1d9bad2f984e170a5","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:20:42-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200828demystifying-drop-out-in-single-cell-rna-seq/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["RNA-seq"],"title":"Demystifying “Drop-Out” in Single Cell RNA-seq","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"  August 28, Intuitive Introduction to Deep Learning, Professor Lawrence Carin, Video\n  September 4, Distributed Machine Learning, Professor Heng Huang, Video\n  September 11, A Representational Model of Grid Cells Based on Matrix Lie Algebras, Professor Ying Nian Wu, Video\n  September 18, Integrating Domain-Knowledge into Deep Learning, Professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Video\n ","date":1598572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598572800,"objectID":"630d66ca387af6833a611151597ae2e2","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200828purdue-university-deep-learning-methods-and-theory-webinar-series/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:29:27-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200828purdue-university-deep-learning-methods-and-theory-webinar-series/","section":"webinar","summary":"Replay links available inside post","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Purdue University: Deep Learning Methods and Theory Webinar Series","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"","date":1598486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598486400,"objectID":"3e8afc3e232dfa21de686dc14707299f","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200827scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:20:04-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200827scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-2/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scaling Data Science at Your Organization (Part 2)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”?

In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.\n","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598313600,"objectID":"241eba1bc389b177160e98424edd073d","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:13:59-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Causal Inference"],"title":"Almost Matching Exactly","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Data Science"],"content":"IPTOP framework (Infrastructure, People, Tools, Organization and Processes) for building data strategies and systematically scaling data science within an organization\n","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"12ca65561671e7d285e76b2c8900bea7","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200820scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-1/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:17:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200820scaling-data-science-at-your-organization-part-1/","section":"webinar","summary":"IPTOP framework (Infrastructure, People, Tools, Organization and Processes) for building data strategies and systematically scaling data science within an organization\n","tags":[],"title":"Scaling Data Science at Your Organization (Part 1)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597795200,"objectID":"bd6efc62824804f3cf87d1582fd3b167","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200819duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:15:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200819duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-2/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Duke-Margolis: Data Sharing to Accelerate Therapeutic Development for Rare Diseases (Day 2)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial"],"content":" Important aspects of Phase II trials designs to consider Practical worked examples of MCP-Mod (continuous outcome) MCP-Mod (binary outcome) Fleming GST (binary outcome) ","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597708800,"objectID":"eae9ac0b5ce93b2d8c68710d350542b0","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2021-03-23T11:11:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200818adaptive-designs-for-phase-ii-clinical-trials/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["Adaptive Designs"],"title":"Adaptive Designs for Phase II Clinical Trials ","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597708800,"objectID":"8e26ccee411cc3eb1f2db09f91fce272","permalink":"https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200818duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-1/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T15:13:55-07:00","relpermalink":"/webinar/20200818duke-margolis-data-sharing-to-accelerate-therapeutic-development-for-rare-diseases-day-1/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Duke-Margolis: Data Sharing to Accelerate Therapeutic Development for Rare Diseases (Day 1)","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In this webinar, I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0.

We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding.

An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (drugs, knockouts, overexpression, etc.) in biology. In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the development of a framework that integrates observational and interventional data and allows predicting the effect of yet unseen interventions or transporting the effect of interventions observed in one context to another. I will present a framework for causal structure discovery based on such data and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable in this setting.
