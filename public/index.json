Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.\nWe explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.\n","date":1594944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594944000,"objectID":"1adb96d3cf2276cf7faf3f914cd23e24","permalink":"https://pwustat.github.io/csetracker/webinar/20200717dahshu/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T15:04:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/csetracker/webinar/20200717dahshu/","section":"webinar","summary":"","tags":["causal effects","health outcome","experimental design"],"title":"Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change","type":"webinar"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Clinical Trial","Statistics"],"content":" An overview of how COVID-19 progressed How can pharmaceutical companies be better prepared?
