      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden. The first approach involves obtaining individual patient input on the relative priority of outcomes through preference instruments based on, for example, item response theory or discrete choice modeling. The second approach adapts inverse reinforcement learning to infer physician outcome priorities, allowing for the possibility of errors in decision making. Both approaches are illustrated with practical examples from mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Agent-based models (ABMs) are computational models used to simulate the actions and interactions of agents within a system. Usually, each agent has a relatively simple set of rules for how it responds to its environment and to other agents. These models are used to gain insight into the emergent behavior of complex systems with many agents, in which the emergent behavior depends upon the micro-level behavior of the individuals. ABMs are widely used in many fields, and this talk emphasizes the challenges that arise in the context various risk analyses (e.g., epidemics, invasive species, insurance). Relatively little work has been done on statistical theory for such models, this talk also points out some of those gaps and recent strategies to address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yuan Ji will discuss his recent publication, Hi3+3: A Model-Assisted Dose-Finding Design Borrowing Historical Data, in the webinar presentation. The purpose of the publication was based on a hybrid design that partly uses probability models and partly uses algorithmic rules for decision making. The aim is to improve the efficiency of the dose-finding trials in the presence of historical data, maintain safety for patients, and achieve a level of simplicity for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health economics has become an increasingly important discipline in medical research. Bodies such as NICE provide guidance based on health economic evaluation. Much of recent research has focused on using advanced statistical decision theoretic approaches in health economic evaluation studies where the interest is in the analysis of a multivariate outcome comprising of clinical benefit and associated costs. Missing data on one or both outcomes is common in these studies. The complex structure of the relationships between the outcomes makes handling missing data more challenging in these studies. In this talk the issues related to missing data in health economic evaluation studies will be discussed and novel statistical models developed to handle missing data using a full Bayesian approach will be described, using as motivating example a pilot study conducted at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Real-world data (RWD) have played an increasingly important role in healthcare decisions, for example supporting the design, analysis, and contextualization of clinical trials. In this webinar, we invite panelists from industry with backgrounds in statistics, clinical trials, data science, epidemiology, and health outcomes research to discuss novel applications where RWD can be used to support clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss propensity-score based methods to leverage RWD as an external data source to augment single-arm clinical trials, enhanced extrapolation of long-term clinical trial survival outcomes using electronic health record (EHR)-derived RWD, and enrollment projection for a prospective pragmatic trial design that utilizes RWD. Finally, we tie the three topics together with a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As policymakers and community leaders have worked to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that statistics and data science can play a critical role in protecting public health and determining the best path forward. Moving from theory to practice presents challenges for working with a patchwork of data from many different sources across public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers will discuss how their work in modeling, inference, predictive analysis, and machine learning has been applied to track the spread of COVID-19, drug use, air pollution, and human trafficking. Panelists will explore the strengths and weaknesses of available surveillance data and how to integrate and draw insight from multiple imperfect data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses the history and characteristics of the R software. R began, 20-odd years ago, as the open source clone of the S software. So the story of R has to start with S and with its history. S came from the Statistics and Data Analysis Research group at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that the design goal of S, and so of R, is to support studies in what we&amp;rsquo;d now call data science. The principles resulting from this goal are still central to computing for data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year on after the final ICH E9 estimands addendum was published, we bring estimands to life. Members of the Estimands in Oncology special interest group will describe how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be guided through a case study and interactively deepen the knowledge to gain hands-on experience in developing estimands. You will be introduced to the background and disease context of the case study, the concept of an estimand, and important clinical events (increased dropout rate and crossover therapy) that occurred in the trial and affected interpretation of the results. Using non-technical language and clear graphical presentation of the concepts, you will experience how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments, their regulatory agencies and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies informing the healthcare payers have the ambition of providing patients with fast access to evidence-based innovations in healthcare. The historical split in objectives and responsibilities of the regulators and the HTA bodies can be seen as one of the reasons for the growing evidence gap remaining after the private sector has performed the trials needed to bring their product to the market. Regulators and HTA bodies differ in their recommendations on patient population, comparators and trial endpoints. The confirmatory trials asked by the regulators may not be fit for purpose to perform HTA nor to inform physicians wanting to practice evidence-based medicine. A better alignment of evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers could accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional option is to perform the missing comparative effectiveness trial in the post-marketing phase. Most informative to healthcare decision-makers are practice-oriented, also named pragmatic trials. Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator. Practice-oriented trials lead to real-world evidence and have proven to be practice-changing. A clear pathway towards the realization of such efficient trial methods is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEY TAKEWAYS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient access to evidence-based innovations can be accelerated if practice-oriented trials are timely conducted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitators would be an alignment of the evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers as well as a framework for an efficient conduct of trials based on coded electronic health records.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>ASA BIOP Webinar: Generalized Pairwise Comparisons for Benefit/Risk Assessment in Personalized Medicine </title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210527asa-biop-webinar-generalized-pairwise-comparisons-for-benefit-risk-assessment-in-personalized-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A novel statistical approach to the analysis of randomized clinical trials uses all pairwise comparisons between two patients, one in the treatment arm and one in the control arm. Each pair favors treatment (“win”), control (“loss”), or neither. The “net treatment benefit” is the difference between the proportion of wins minus the proportion of losses. Pairwise comparisons can incorporate several outcomes of interest and several thresholds of clinical relevance in the analysis, and as such, they can be used to personalize treatment choices and to assess the benefit/risk of randomized therapeutic interventions in a rigorous yet flexible manner (Buyse 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages and limitations of generalized pairwise comparisons will be illustrated using two typical examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a single time-to-event endpoint, the net survival benefit is a meaningful measure of treatment effect whether or not hazards are proportional. When a delayed treatment effect is anticipated, for example in immune-oncology trials, the net benefit is appealing because it stresses benefits that are clinically worthwhile on the time scale. The test based on the net survival benefit can also gain power as compared to the traditional logrank test if interest focuses on long-term survival differences (Péron 2016a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anticancer treatment have substantial toxicities that may counterbalance treatment benefits. Generalized pairwise comparisons can be used to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments. This will be illustrated using several randomized trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Péron 2016b).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not always clear how to adjust for control data in causal inference, balancing the goals of reducing bias and variance. We show how, in a setting with repeated experiments, Bayesian hierarchical modeling yields an adaptive procedure that uses the data to determine how much adjustment to perform. The result is a novel analysis with increased statistical efficiency compared to the default analysis based on difference estimates. We demonstrate this procedure on two real examples, as well as on a series of simulated datasets. We show that the increased efficiency can have real-world consequences in terms of the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. We also discuss the relevance of this work to causal inference and statistical design and analysis more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Professor Bianca De Stavola will discuss how life course investigations may characterise the impact of exposures over time (e.g., continuous or time-specific) and across dimensions (e.g., via joint or distinct pathways), and how different study designs may aid them. She will also compare ‘traditional’ approaches to gather evidence for causality and potential areas of intervention with the formality and clarity of counterfactual-based estimands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this presentation, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on clinical trial case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer vision application in the medical domain have recently become quite popular. Detecting, localizing, and diagnosing diseases and recognizing structures on MRI, CT, PET, XRay, ultrasound and photographic images is efficiently done by AI. What is rarely discussed, is how these AI systems are made. They require copious amounts of training data consisting of images and human-supplied labels. The labels are marked areas (either rectangles or free-form boundaries) that are attached to a word, e.g. “tumor.” Naturally, only highly qualified professionals are able to provide these labels making the process effortful and expensive. A technique called “active learning” from AI can help with this by reducing the manual effort by 90%. This allows the creation of state-of-the-art AI models for medicine using a significantly smaller budget of time and resources. This talk will present the method with several examples and will argue that this approach is a disruptive shift in medical AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past year has seen a huge increase in the communication of statistical, medical, and public health concepts, methods, and results to broad audiences.  The general public has been exposed to the ideas of reproduction numbers, exponential growth, randomized trials, and the challenges of program evaluation in ways that had rarely been seen at such a large scale.  This webinar will provide a discussion between two experts in scientific communication&amp;ndash;Jenn Dowd, co-founder of Dear Pandemic and Associate Professor at the University of Oxford, and Ed Yong, staff writer at The Atlantic. They will discuss what they have learned during the course of the pandemic about communicating statistical/epidemiological concepts to broad audiences, what challenges remain, and how might we best address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has deeply penetrated the neuroimaging field in the past 15 years, by providing a means to construct imaging signatures of normal and pathologic brain states on an individual person basis. In this talk, I will discuss examples from our laboratory’s work on imaging signatures of brain aging and early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as brain cancer precision diagnostics and estimation of molecular characteristics. I will discuss some challenges, such as disease heterogeneity, integration of data from multiple sites, and derivation of interpretable statistical maps from certain machine learning tools, and will present some of our work in these directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applications of single-cell RNA sequencing in various biomedical research areas have been blooming. This new technology provides unprecedented opportunities to study disease heterogeneity at the cellular level. However, unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including large dimensionality, high dropout rates, and possibly batch effects, bring great difficulty into the analysis of such data. Not appropriately addressing these issues obstructs true scientific discovery. Herein, we propose a unified Regularized Zero-inflated Mixture Model framework designed for scRNA-seq data (RZiMM-scRNA) to simultaneously detect cell subgroups and identify gene differential expression based on a developed importance score, accounting for both dropouts and batch effects. We conduct extensive empirical investigation to demonstrate the promise of RZiMM-scRNA in comparison to several popular methods, including K-means and Hierarchical clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210423dynamic-data-monitoring-of-ongoing-clinical-trials/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report, nearly 70% Phase II trials failed to move forward to Phase III. Part of the reasons caused such high failure rate could be inefficient trial design and trial monitoring. In this talk, we introduce the concept of dynamic data monitoring (DDM) for ongoing clinical trials. We develop the principles and procedures for dynamically monitoring on-going clinical trials and demonstrate that the accumulative treatment effect can be automatically estimated and continuously accessible over the information time. Building on the adaptive group sequential (AGS) methods, and by taking the advantage of modern eClinical technologies, we developed a clinical trial “radar” system on which the Wald statistics, conditional power, trend, timing for sample size re-estimation, alerting of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility can be automatically displayed. Thus, the trail can be intelligently monitored. Through simulation, we demonstrate the power of DDM in guiding a promising trial to success or detecting a “hopeless” trial to stop. We provide an example of DDM application in the 1st remdesivir trial in Wuhan China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current pandemic the need to translate clinical data into actionable research to inform patient care has never been more urgent. Using the Precision Medicine Analytics Platform at Johns Hopkins University, a team of clinicians, biostatisticians and information technologists at the Precision Medicine Center of Excellence for COVID-19 rapidly created a COVID-19 patient registry and deployed an array of biostatistical methods to understand patient trajectories, conduct comparative effectiveness research for therapeutics, learn about pathobiology of COVID-19 and implement a real-time prediction model into the electronic health record (EHR). Join this session to hear about the lessons learned from conducting research in real time while building a complex data registry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In modern drug development, the broader availability of high-dimensional observational data provides opportunities for scientist to explore subgroup heterogeneity, especially when randomized clinical trials are unavailable due to cost and ethical constraints. However, a common practice that naively searches the subgroup with a high treatment level is often misleading due to the “subgroup selection bias.” More importantly, the nature of high-dimensional observational data has further exacerbated the challenge of accurately estimating the subgroup treatment effects. To resolve these issues, we provide new inferential tools based on resampling to assess the replicability of post-hoc identified subgroups from observational studies. Through careful theoretical justification and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence intervals and debiased estimates for the selected subgroup treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. We further demonstrate the merit of the proposed methods by analyzing the UK Biobank data. The R package “debiased.subgroup&amp;quot; implementing the proposed procedures is available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will play the part of a sponsor consulting a statistician with the goal of designing a randomized trial with sample-size re-estimation. We will discuss the concept of conditional power and the promising-zone method, and we will present a pragmatic view of some issues, including when to plan the sample-size re-estimation in the course of the accrual, how to select the amount of sample-size increase, and how to operate such trials in practice. We will also discuss the pros- and cons- of using this type of design in relation to the clinical setting in which the trial is designed and endpoints it uses. Moreover, we will discuss the regulators’ views and illustrate our discussion with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic control arms leverage real world data from various sources or evaluations of historical clinical data to demonstrate the positive effects of a new therapy or treatment, without the need to use a placebo or standard of care as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in both the United States and Europe have responded positively to the use of SCAs in clinical development. While implementation of this method for regulatory purposes might be a new development, the majority of statistical and mathematical theories used for the design of SCAs are decades old and familiar to the scientific community. However, synthetic control arm studies are often subject to many misplaced industry myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this webinar our panel of expert speakers from Cytel, Roche and CIOX Health, will share their insights and bust Real-World Data industry myths around the use of synthetic controls in research and regulatory applications. In addition, they will dispel and bust a number of myths related to their specific sector of industry, namely pharma, data vendor, and consulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first provide a historical overview of the epidemic in Wuhan. I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates. I will also present the analysis results of &amp;gt;500,000 participants of the HowWeFeel project on health outcomes and behaviors in US, and discuss the factors associated with infection, behavior, and vaccine hesitancy. I will provide several takeaways and discuss priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a statistically optimal approach to construct data-driven decisions for stochastic optimization problems. Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The growth of availability and variety of healthcare data sources has provided unique opportunities for data integration and evidence synthesis, which can potentially accelerate knowledge discovery and enable better clinical decision making.  However, many practical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, high-dimensionality and heterogeneity across different datasets, remain to be addressed. In this talk, I will introduce several methods for effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data. Our algorithms are able to account for heterogeneity across different datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms, and examples of implementing the algorithms to real-world clinical research networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning. In this talk, I will discuss a novel framework, namely neural interaction detector (NID), for interpreting complex neural networks by detecting statistical interactions captured by the neural networks. Furthermore, we can construct a more interpretable generalized additive model that achieve similar prediction performance as the original neural networks. Experiment results on several applications, such as recommender systems, image recognition, sentiment prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of NID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a pillar of A.I. and has driven most of recent cutting-edge discoveries in biomedical research. In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the &amp;ldquo;dangers&amp;rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional vaccine clinical development is an undertaking involving meticulous, multiple studies in multiple populations at risk of infection and disease over multiple years. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine development is following this traditional development pathway, but accelerated Phase I-II-III clinical programs are being applied (c.f., USA FDA guidances 2020). This is not the first time vaccines have been manufactured and tested quickly to meet a public health crisis (1976, 2009). Selected statistical concepts pertaining to vaccine efficacy and safety, relevant during the design and implementation of such crisis programs, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this event was to shed light on and explain the main features (pro and con) that surround some of the controversies on use of p-values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Berger (Duke University) has been exploring the Bayesian and frequentist foundations of statistics for 50 years, and has recently been heavily involved in bringing these foundational perspectives to the p-value debate. David Trafimow (New Mexico State University) started the serious questioning of any use of p-values via the journal he edits, and Deborah Mayo (Virginia Tech) has developed a reformulation of frequentist error statistical methods within a full-blown philosophy of learning from error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session I: A Robust Sentinel System for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: In response to new legislative mandates and the desire to diversify scientific expertise and enhance core key capabilities in the Sentinel System, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has awarded a new five-year contract that establishes a new organizational structure for the Sentinel Coordinating Center. This new contract builds on FDA successes integrating the active, post-market safety surveillance into regulatory decision-making. This session will feature key leads from each Sentinel coordinating center who will discuss plans on how to advance and transform Sentinel’s data infrastructure into a national resource for evidence generation. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for collaboration to broaden stakeholder involvement, improve access to new data sources and analytic tools, and ensure more efficient and effective safety surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session II: Building the BEST Network and Establishing New Capabilities for the Surveillance of Biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: Launched in 2017, the BEST Initiative enacts the Agency’s mandate to implement active surveillance for biologic products. This session will highlight key achievements of BEST over the last year enhancing its capabilities to execute safety and effectiveness surveillance and inform regulatory decision making. CBER representatives will discuss ongoing work to support the expansion of the BEST data network and methods infrastructure as well as specific studies utilizing the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session III: Leveraging the Sentinel Initiative for COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: The U.S. FDA’s Sentinel Initiative is engaged in numerous activities to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will highlight key ongoing efforts across CDER and CBER to leverage Sentinel data infrastructure to describe course of illness, and evaluate the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of available COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-proportional Hazards&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster Randomization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hree Armed Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison.  In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistics and optimization are two of the foundational pillars of machine learning, and it is well recognized that optimization provides powerful tools for statistics. In recent years, techniques of the complementary nature, i.e., using statistics to improve optimization algorithms, have become increasingly successful. In this talk, we present several recent works on such statistical optimization methods. First, we discuss how to use statistical hypothesis testing to automatically adjust the learning rate of stochastic gradient methods in training deep neural networks. Then we overview some recent advances in structured nonconvex optimization using stochastic variance reduction techniques. Finally we will briefly explain how to leverage statistical preconditioning to accelerate distributed optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The R language is used extensively throughout the pharmaceutical industry. But its use within the tightly regulated clinical reporting workflows has remained limited. GSK Biostatistics has embarked upon a journey to embed R as a primary statistical analysis tool for clinical reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling R within a global department of over 600 Statisticians, Programmers and Data Scientists is challenging! It requires planning, patience, and a strong foundation that enables consistency across the enterprise. We invite you to learn more about how we achieved this at GSK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about our tidyverse-centric training program, a future-ready Working Area for R Programming (WARP) environment, and a leading-edge R for Clinical Reporting (R4CR) initiative. The goal: help embed R in every-day clinical reporting output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have changed the landscape of genomics research in complex biological systems by producing single cell resolution data at affordable costs. In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”? This is a very common misconception among data scientists, and a very broad definition of data science as a whole. For data science to be impactful, it needs to be credible, agile, and durable. To be able to do this, we need to embrace the differences between R vs. Python. Maybe you prefer R for data wrangling and Python for modeling - that’s great! Why should serious data science be stifled for the sake of language loyalty? Data science teams need to use the wealth of tools available to them to deliver the most impactful results. This webinar will be a discussion among data science leaders, debunking this common myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Almost Matching Exactly</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will present a matching framework for causal inference in the potential outcomes setting called Almost Matching Exactly. In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0. The biggest new idea in testthat 3.0.0 is the idea of an edition. You must deliberately choose to use the 3rd edition, which allows us to make breaking changes without breaking old packages. testthat 3e deprecates a number of older functions that we no longer believe are a good idea, and tweaks the behaviour of expect_equal() and expect_identical() to give considerably more informative output (using the new waldo package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testthat 3e also introduces the idea of snapshot tests which record expected value in external files, rather than in code. This makes them particularly well suited to testing user output and complex objects. I&amp;rsquo;ll show off the main advantages of snapshot testing, and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than our previous approaches of verify_output() and expect_known_output().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over a bunch of smaller quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to test reporting and improvements to expect_error(), expect_warning() and expect_message().&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the right dose in Phase 2 gives a potential new therapy its best chance to demonstrate efficacy during Phase 3. A well-executed dose-ranging trial therefore has the potential to alter the course of the entire clinical development program. This webinar demonstrates how adaptive and Bayesian techniques can be implemented for optimal dose-finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In social science we learn from stories.  The best stories are anomalous and immutable.  We shall briefly discuss the theory of stories, the paradoxical nature of how we learn from them, and how this relates to forward and reverse causal inference.  Then we will go through some stories of applied causal inference and see what lessons we can draw from them.  We hope this talk will be useful as a model for how you can better learn from own experiences as participants and consumers of causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Survival Analysis Designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and other complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at power analysis assuming complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as one candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepped-Wedge designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will introduce stepped-wedge designs and provide an insight into the more complex, flexible randomization schedules available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MAMs designs provide the ability to assess more treatments in less time than could be done with a series of two-arm trials and can offer smaller sample size requirements when compared to that required for the equivalent number of two-arm trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at the design of a Group Sequential MAMS design and explore its design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200717dahshu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.&lt;br&gt;
We explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;The value of good design of experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider Bayesian statistics to answer your question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P-values is not always what you’re looking for&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications. Dynamic emails are a powerful way to meet decision makers where they live - their inbox - while displaying exactly the results needed to influence decision-making. Best of all, these notifications are crafted with code, ensuring your work is still reproducible, durable, and credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll demonstrate how this approach provides solutions for data quality monitoring, detecting and alerting on anomalies, and can even automate routine (but precisely formatted) KPI reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (drugs, knockouts, overexpression, etc.) in biology. In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the development of a framework that integrates observational and interventional data and allows predicting the effect of yet unseen interventions or transporting the effect of interventions observed in one context to another. I will present a framework for causal structure discovery based on such data and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable in this setting. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
