      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will play the part of a sponsor consulting a statistician with the goal of designing a randomized trial with sample-size re-estimation. We will discuss the concept of conditional power and the promising-zone method, and we will present a pragmatic view of some issues, including when to plan the sample-size re-estimation in the course of the accrual, how to select the amount of sample-size increase, and how to operate such trials in practice. We will also discuss the pros- and cons- of using this type of design in relation to the clinical setting in which the trial is designed and endpoints it uses. Moreover, we will discuss the regulators’ views and illustrate our discussion with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic control arms leverage real world data from various sources or evaluations of historical clinical data to demonstrate the positive effects of a new therapy or treatment, without the need to use a placebo or standard of care as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in both the United States and Europe have responded positively to the use of SCAs in clinical development. While implementation of this method for regulatory purposes might be a new development, the majority of statistical and mathematical theories used for the design of SCAs are decades old and familiar to the scientific community. However, synthetic control arm studies are often subject to many misplaced industry myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this webinar our panel of expert speakers from Cytel, Roche and CIOX Health, will share their insights and bust Real-World Data industry myths around the use of synthetic controls in research and regulatory applications. In addition, they will dispel and bust a number of myths related to their specific sector of industry, namely pharma, data vendor, and consulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nonmembers: $35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first provide a historical overview of the epidemic in Wuhan. I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates. I will also present the analysis results of &amp;gt;500,000 participants of the HowWeFeel project on health outcomes and behaviors in US, and discuss the factors associated with infection, behavior, and vaccine hesitancy. I will provide several takeaways and discuss priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210319general-framework-for-optimal-data-driven-optimization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a statistically optimal approach to construct data-driven decisions for stochastic optimization problems. Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identification of Putative Causal Loci in Whole-Genome Sequencing Data via Knockoff Statistics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of whole-genome sequencing studies is challenging due to the large number of rare variants in noncoding regions and the lack of natural units for testing. Existing association tests often suffer from insufficient power due to the substantially increased burden of multiple testing and correspondingly stringent multiple testing corrections that do not appropriately account for correlations. Using population-level whole-genome sequencing data, we propose a new statistical method to detect and localize rare and common risk variants based on a recently developed knockoff framework. The proposed approach includes a novel sequential knockoff generator for both rare and common variants in whole-genome sequencing studies, paired with a powerful screening method to comprehensively analyze rare and common variants across the genome. The proposed knockoff generator is scalable to large whole-genome sequencing datasets, and the screening method is powerful in detecting signals across the genome with guaranteed false discovery rate control. Furthermore, it can (1) prioritize causal variants over associations due to linkage disequilibrium thereby improving interpretability; (2) help distinguish the signal due to rare variants from shadow effects of significant common variants nearby; (3) integrate multiple knockoffs for improved power, stability and reproducibility; and (4) flexibly incorporate state-of-the-art and future association tests to achieve the benefits proposed here. In applications to whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and COPDGene samples from NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program we show that our method compared with conventional association tests can lead to substantially more discoveries, including several new ones and many previously implicated in GWAS studies on Alzheimer’s Disease and lung function phenotypes with much larger sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning. In this talk, I will discuss a novel framework, namely neural interaction detector (NID), for interpreting complex neural networks by detecting statistical interactions captured by the neural networks. Furthermore, we can construct a more interpretable generalized additive model that achieve similar prediction performance as the original neural networks. Experiment results on several applications, such as recommender systems, image recognition, sentiment prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of NID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Veridical Data Science for biomedical discovery: detecting epistatic interactions with epiTree</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a pillar of A.I. and has driven most of recent cutting-edge discoveries in biomedical research. In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the &amp;ldquo;dangers&amp;rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional vaccine clinical development is an undertaking involving meticulous, multiple studies in multiple populations at risk of infection and disease over multiple years. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine development is following this traditional development pathway, but accelerated Phase I-II-III clinical programs are being applied (c.f., USA FDA guidances 2020). This is not the first time vaccines have been manufactured and tested quickly to meet a public health crisis (1976, 2009). Selected statistical concepts pertaining to vaccine efficacy and safety, relevant during the design and implementation of such crisis programs, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session I: A Robust Sentinel System for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: In response to new legislative mandates and the desire to diversify scientific expertise and enhance core key capabilities in the Sentinel System, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has awarded a new five-year contract that establishes a new organizational structure for the Sentinel Coordinating Center. This new contract builds on FDA successes integrating the active, post-market safety surveillance into regulatory decision-making. This session will feature key leads from each Sentinel coordinating center who will discuss plans on how to advance and transform Sentinel’s data infrastructure into a national resource for evidence generation. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for collaboration to broaden stakeholder involvement, improve access to new data sources and analytic tools, and ensure more efficient and effective safety surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session II: Building the BEST Network and Establishing New Capabilities for the Surveillance of Biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: Launched in 2017, the BEST Initiative enacts the Agency’s mandate to implement active surveillance for biologic products. This session will highlight key achievements of BEST over the last year enhancing its capabilities to execute safety and effectiveness surveillance and inform regulatory decision making. CBER representatives will discuss ongoing work to support the expansion of the BEST data network and methods infrastructure as well as specific studies utilizing the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session III: Leveraging the Sentinel Initiative for COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: The U.S. FDA’s Sentinel Initiative is engaged in numerous activities to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will highlight key ongoing efforts across CDER and CBER to leverage Sentinel data infrastructure to describe course of illness, and evaluate the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of available COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Yu will first discuss how her volunteer team fought to have brought data transparency to CovidNet. Then, Kyle will present his team’s novel approach to continuous data quality monitoring, which combines semantic analysis with time series anomaly detection methods, ending with some examples showing issues (known and benign) detected in the 1point3acres dataset. Prof Shan Lu will also provide an example how the high quality data source can be highly useful for even non-biological scientists to produce meaningful analysis in a situation like COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-proportional Hazards&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster Randomization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hree Armed Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison.  In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200915statistical-optimization-methods-for-machine-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistics and optimization are two of the foundational pillars of machine learning, and it is well recognized that optimization provides powerful tools for statistics. In recent years, techniques of the complementary nature, i.e., using statistics to improve optimization algorithms, have become increasingly successful. In this talk, we present several recent works on such statistical optimization methods. First, we discuss how to use statistical hypothesis testing to automatically adjust the learning rate of stochastic gradient methods in training deep neural networks. Then we overview some recent advances in structured nonconvex optimization using stochastic variance reduction techniques. Finally we will briefly explain how to leverage statistical preconditioning to accelerate distributed optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The R language is used extensively throughout the pharmaceutical industry. But its use within the tightly regulated clinical reporting workflows has remained limited. GSK Biostatistics has embarked upon a journey to embed R as a primary statistical analysis tool for clinical reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling R within a global department of over 600 Statisticians, Programmers and Data Scientists is challenging! It requires planning, patience, and a strong foundation that enables consistency across the enterprise. We invite you to learn more about how we achieved this at GSK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about our tidyverse-centric training program, a future-ready Working Area for R Programming (WARP) environment, and a leading-edge R for Clinical Reporting (R4CR) initiative. The goal: help embed R in every-day clinical reporting output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have changed the landscape of genomics research in complex biological systems by producing single cell resolution data at affordable costs. In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”? This is a very common misconception among data scientists, and a very broad definition of data science as a whole. For data science to be impactful, it needs to be credible, agile, and durable. To be able to do this, we need to embrace the differences between R vs. Python. Maybe you prefer R for data wrangling and Python for modeling - that’s great! Why should serious data science be stifled for the sake of language loyalty? Data science teams need to use the wealth of tools available to them to deliver the most impactful results. This webinar will be a discussion among data science leaders, debunking this common myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Almost Matching Exactly</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will present a matching framework for causal inference in the potential outcomes setting called Almost Matching Exactly. In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0. The biggest new idea in testthat 3.0.0 is the idea of an edition. You must deliberately choose to use the 3rd edition, which allows us to make breaking changes without breaking old packages. testthat 3e deprecates a number of older functions that we no longer believe are a good idea, and tweaks the behaviour of expect_equal() and expect_identical() to give considerably more informative output (using the new waldo package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testthat 3e also introduces the idea of snapshot tests which record expected value in external files, rather than in code. This makes them particularly well suited to testing user output and complex objects. I&amp;rsquo;ll show off the main advantages of snapshot testing, and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than our previous approaches of verify_output() and expect_known_output().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over a bunch of smaller quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to test reporting and improvements to expect_error(), expect_warning() and expect_message().&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the right dose in Phase 2 gives a potential new therapy its best chance to demonstrate efficacy during Phase 3. A well-executed dose-ranging trial therefore has the potential to alter the course of the entire clinical development program. This webinar demonstrates how adaptive and Bayesian techniques can be implemented for optimal dose-finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In social science we learn from stories.  The best stories are anomalous and immutable.  We shall briefly discuss the theory of stories, the paradoxical nature of how we learn from them, and how this relates to forward and reverse causal inference.  Then we will go through some stories of applied causal inference and see what lessons we can draw from them.  We hope this talk will be useful as a model for how you can better learn from own experiences as participants and consumers of causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Survival Analysis Designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and other complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at power analysis assuming complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as one candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepped-Wedge designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will introduce stepped-wedge designs and provide an insight into the more complex, flexible randomization schedules available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MAMs designs provide the ability to assess more treatments in less time than could be done with a series of two-arm trials and can offer smaller sample size requirements when compared to that required for the equivalent number of two-arm trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at the design of a Group Sequential MAMS design and explore its design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.&lt;br&gt;
We explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications. Dynamic emails are a powerful way to meet decision makers where they live - their inbox - while displaying exactly the results needed to influence decision-making. Best of all, these notifications are crafted with code, ensuring your work is still reproducible, durable, and credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll demonstrate how this approach provides solutions for data quality monitoring, detecting and alerting on anomalies, and can even automate routine (but precisely formatted) KPI reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptations to tumor response and progression criteria for immune therapies. Survival may be the endpoint of choice for clinical trials in some tumor types, but presence of delayed treatment effects and non-proportional hazards may complicate evaluation of treatment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical methods to best describe and test for treatment effects in immuno-oncology randomized clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (drugs, knockouts, overexpression, etc.) in biology. In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the development of a framework that integrates observational and interventional data and allows predicting the effect of yet unseen interventions or transporting the effect of interventions observed in one context to another. I will present a framework for causal structure discovery based on such data and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable in this setting. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of how COVID-19 progressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can pharmaceutical companies be better prepared? Should there be plans and clinical development strategies in place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we build resiliency? What steps could/should be implemented at various stages to ‘flatten the curve’?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerable communities and minority populations are at a disadvantage. How do we address these health disparities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
