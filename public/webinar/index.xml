      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will play the part of a sponsor consulting a statistician with the goal of designing a randomized trial with sample-size re-estimation. We will discuss the concept of conditional power and the promising-zone method, and we will present a pragmatic view of some issues, including when to plan the sample-size re-estimation in the course of the accrual, how to select the amount of sample-size increase, and how to operate such trials in practice. We will also discuss the pros- and cons- of using this type of design in relation to the clinical setting in which the trial is designed and endpoints it uses. Moreover, we will discuss the regulators’ views and illustrate our discussion with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first provide a historical overview of the epidemic in Wuhan. I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates. I will also present the analysis results of &amp;gt;500,000 participants of the HowWeFeel project on health outcomes and behaviors in US, and discuss the factors associated with infection, behavior, and vaccine hesitancy. I will provide several takeaways and discuss priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identification of Putative Causal Loci in Whole-Genome Sequencing Data via Knockoff Statistics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of whole-genome sequencing studies is challenging due to the large number of rare variants in noncoding regions and the lack of natural units for testing. Existing association tests often suffer from insufficient power due to the substantially increased burden of multiple testing and correspondingly stringent multiple testing corrections that do not appropriately account for correlations. Using population-level whole-genome sequencing data, we propose a new statistical method to detect and localize rare and common risk variants based on a recently developed knockoff framework. The proposed approach includes a novel sequential knockoff generator for both rare and common variants in whole-genome sequencing studies, paired with a powerful screening method to comprehensively analyze rare and common variants across the genome. The proposed knockoff generator is scalable to large whole-genome sequencing datasets, and the screening method is powerful in detecting signals across the genome with guaranteed false discovery rate control. Furthermore, it can (1) prioritize causal variants over associations due to linkage disequilibrium thereby improving interpretability; (2) help distinguish the signal due to rare variants from shadow effects of significant common variants nearby; (3) integrate multiple knockoffs for improved power, stability and reproducibility; and (4) flexibly incorporate state-of-the-art and future association tests to achieve the benefits proposed here. In applications to whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and COPDGene samples from NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program we show that our method compared with conventional association tests can lead to substantially more discoveries, including several new ones and many previously implicated in GWAS studies on Alzheimer’s Disease and lung function phenotypes with much larger sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Yu will first discuss how her volunteer team fought to have brought data transparency to CovidNet. Then, Kyle will present his team’s novel approach to continuous data quality monitoring, which combines semantic analysis with time series anomaly detection methods, ending with some examples showing issues (known and benign) detected in the 1point3acres dataset. Prof Shan Lu will also provide an example how the high quality data source can be highly useful for even non-biological scientists to produce meaningful analysis in a situation like COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200717dahshu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.&lt;br&gt;
We explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;An overview of how COVID-19 progressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can pharmaceutical companies be better prepared? Should there be plans and clinical development strategies in place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we build resiliency? What steps could/should be implemented at various stages to ‘flatten the curve’?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerable communities and minority populations are at a disadvantage. How do we address these health disparities?&lt;/li&gt;
