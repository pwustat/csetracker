&lt;p&gt;Confirmatory platform trials are recently gaining popularity in the pharmaceutical industry. Several such trials have been initiated in the past years; many of these (such as GBM Agile and PANCAN Precision Promise) are multi-sponsor trials. In contrast to similar master protocol designs (such as basket trials) which are well-established in earlier phases of clinical development, the use of platform trial designs for confirmatory studies is still subject to some debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, there is currently no consensus on the importance of type I error control. In the spectrum from strict control of the Familywise-error rate control (FWER) across the entire platform to no type I error control at all, few researchers take the extreme positions, but within this range, opinions vary. Among the alternative concepts, compromises such as population-wise and treatment-wise error rate control have been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss some of these concepts. Subsequently, we will consider how type I error rate control can be guaranteed in platform trials when techniques such as response adaptive randomization or permitting new treatments into an ongoing platform trial are used. It turns out that adaptive design methodology can be adapted to such uses, but a power loss cannot be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of clinical trials show a successful outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies. This has resulted in multiple US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in the last few years. Flow cytometry has become an important tool in these clinical trials to monitor the presence and expansion of CAR T cells in patients. Immunophenotyping of CAR T cells by flow cytometry has provided valuable information to clinicians which helps to further improve the CAR T-cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The featured speakers will discuss the role of flow cytometry in identifying the markers expressed on malignant plasma cells, which facilitates the selection of CAR T-cell therapy. Attendees will learn about the aspects of flow cytometry assays in CAR T-cell and plasma cell monitoring in multiple myeloma (MM) trials. In addition, the speakers will discuss the challenges of developing flow cytometry assays for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join this webinar to learn the use of flow cytometry for the monitoring, phenotyping and characterization of CAR T cells in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Differentiating prognostic vs. predictive biomarkers impacts important decision makings for patients and treating physicians in precision medicine. Using hazard ratio (HR) can mistake a purely prognostic biomarker for a predictive one leading to a disheartening possibility of depriving patients of beneficial treatment as demonstrated in the OAK trial. This stems from the illogical issue of HR at population level where marginal HR in the overall population can be larger than those in both subgroups. The subgroup task force within the Oncology Estimand industry-wide working group discussed such issues and proposes the use alternative logic-respecting efficacy estimands such as ratio of medians, ratio and difference of restricted mean survival times and milestone probabilities. These measures are straightforward, easy to interpret and clinically meaningful. More importantly, they will lead to agreement between marginal and conditional efficacy estimates when analyzing real clinical trial data as long as logic-ensuring analysis principle such as Subgroup Mixable Estimation (SME) is followed. Detailed guidance is provided using either parametric or non-parametric approaches. Simultaneous inference can be provided with proper multiplicity adjustment to facilitate joint decision making with user-friendly apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses analysis of repeated measures for binary, ordered polytomous, continuous, and semi-continuous outcomes frequently seen in mental health research. The first part of the talk considers panel data with a small number of time points (5-10). A random effects two-part ordinal model is introduced for longitudinal analysis of treatment effects and random intercept cross-lagged modeling (RI-CLPM). The second part of the talk considers intensive longitudinal data with many time points (50-100). Two-level time series analysis (dynamic structural equation modeling; DSEM) is used for modeling of daily cycles by sine-cosine curves as well as two-part modeling of semi-continuous outcomes that have strong floor effects. Examples are drawn from a randomized trial of treatments of alcohol dependence, a study of suicidal ideation and substance abuse, and studies of negative affect and at-risk mood profiles related to depression in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current drug development model is confronted by major challenges including rising clinical trial costs, a tougher competitive landscape, and 
growing pressure from payers. Consequently, there is an increasing
awareness that drug development must be fundamentally updated to meet
these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar first addresses why transformation is needed from a pharma
development and from an investor perspective. It then discusses three areas 
of innovation where biostatisticians can play a major role. The seminar will 
conclude with a panel discussion with all speakers and members from 
pharma and regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we shall argue that approaches to quantitative decision making can be divided into three areas or cultures: First, approaches based classical statistical thinking that aim to use the tools of statistical inference and experimental design to provide solutions with well understood operating characteristics. Second, those based on modeling to provide a good approximation and then potentially use simulation to propagate uncertainty around a target, leading to a basis for decision making. Finally, those based on machine learning that is often used to reduce complex high dimensional problems and provide the basis for prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall review problems in a drug development setting using a case-study from a psoriatic arthritis drug development program to illustrate the richness and complexity of data collected during clinical development. Next, we shall show how each of the cultures can provide excellent solutions to certain problems. However, with increased use of data from a variety of sources, there is often a need to combine these three cultures to bring an appropriate solution to a problem. To illustrate this, we shall look at a class of problems where two treatments or options need to be compared but a randomized experiment is not possible. We shall review solutions that combine machine learning, statistical inference and potentially modeling. In addition, we shall review the problem of identifying prognostic and predictive factors using the knockoff approach, which combines control of operating characteristics with realistically complex modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When an intercurrent event in itself is considered to be informative about the treatments&#39; effect on patients&#39; outcomes, the intercurrent event is often incorporated into the definition of the variable. The ICH E9 (R1) addendum refers to this as the composite strategy. In this event, speakers will present different composite estimand strategies for clinical trials, the analyses that target these estimands (e.g., trimmed means, rank-based approaches), and regulatory considerations for clinical trials with composite estimands and endpoints. A discussant will reflect on the presentations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimands are characterized by the following three attributes: Prospective, systematic, and collaborative. Estimands are prospective because we need to be clear at the design stage of a clinical trial about the treatment effect of interest. Estimands are systematic because the E9 addendum offers a structured approach and language to precisely describe the treatment effect of interest. Finally, estimates are collaborative because clinicians and statisticians need to work closely together to describe a treatment effect of interest that is clinically meaningful and can be estimated robustly and with minimal assumptions at trial end. Focusing on this last aspect of collaboration, we share in this presentation our experiences and provide examples to illustrate successful interdisciplinary discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Randomized clinical trials use either stratified or unstratified randomization. For the former, the stratification factors are typically categorical baseline covariates (region, age group, ECOG status, etc.) that are presumed to influence the clinical endpoint of interest. We caution that uncertainty at the trial design stage can contribute to &amp;ldquo;ineffective&amp;rdquo; stratification and the corresponding stratified analysis can lead to an adversely biased or imprecisely estimated treatment effect, especially for trials designed to assess whether a test treatment prolongs survival relative to a control treatment. To mitigate this non-trivial risk, we show how “effective” stratification can be achieved using a pre-specified treatment-blinded algorithm applied to the clinical trial outcomes, followed by a power-boosting stratified analysis after treatment unblinding. We illustrate the utility of our proposed ‘5-STAR’ approach relative to current practice using a graphical summary of p-values and hazard ratio estimates from 23 real data examples. We also discuss alignment of our novel proposal with FDA guidance on covariate-adjusted analyses, and with related publications by John Tukey, Stuart Pocock, and others. (An R package to implement 5-STAR is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmarceauwest/fiveSTAR&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rmarceauwest/fiveSTAR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In practical dose response trials, especially in a cell culture context, experimental designs to establish functional relationships between dose and effect of a substance are generally chosen based on simple rules of thumb. These designs are generally reasonably effective, but not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar we give an overview over the statistical optimal design approach in this context. We show how optimal designs can be constructed, covering mainly all-purpose designs (D-optimality) but also more specific designs (c-optimality). We introduce a graphical representation. Next, we show how these concepts can be extended to trials aiming to estimate the interaction between two different substances given simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we present an R-Shiny application which allows construction of optimal designs in most of these contexts with a minimum of theoretical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue of multiplicity often arises in the design and analysis of clinical trials. Common multiple test problems include comparing several treatments with a control, assessing the benefit of a new treatment for more than one endpoint, combined non-inferiority and superiority testing, or any combination thereof. This short course will be on the graphical approach’s flexible and transparent implementation of multiple testing. Using graphical approaches, one can easily construct and explore different test strategies and thus tailor the test procedure to the given study objectives. The resulting multiple test procedures are represented by directed, weighted graphs, where each node corresponds to an elementary hypothesis, together with a simple algorithm to generate such graphs while sequentially testing the individual hypotheses. We also present case studies to illustrate how the approach can be used in clinical practice and provide relevant extensions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;R has risen to become the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute &amp;ldquo;faster&amp;rdquo; make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the dozen+ years since its initial release, the Rcpp package has become the most-widely used language extension for the R system.  By our calculations, almost a quarter (23.5%) of CRAN packages use compiled code. And well over half (56.2%) of these deploy Rcpp&amp;mdash;a total of 2502 packages making it the most-widely-used language extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to gently introduce going to &lt;em&gt;compiled code&lt;/em&gt; without fear thanks to sophisticated tooling which makes otherwise complicated and sometimes feared steps of compiling, linking, loading and launching compiled code a relative breeze that is accessible directly from R&amp;mdash;by leveraging the excellent and robust build toolchain supplied by R. It also highlights key aspects, and motivations, of using Rcpp&amp;mdash;and will also warn of a few common pitfalls.  Pointers for further study as well as to additional examples offer an opportunity for self-study following this introductory talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the speakers &amp;amp; their talks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr Brennan Kahan (UCL)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title/Abstract: Estimands in randomised trials: ensuring trials get the right answer to the right question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact treatment effect being estimated in a randomised trial is often unclear, or in some cases, not relevant to clinical decision making. Estimands are a way of clarifying the treatment effect of interest, and can be used to (i) ensure the question being addressed is clear and clinically relevant; and (ii) ensure the trial is appropriately designed and analysed to answer the question of interest. In this talk I will describe the estimands framework, including: (a) what estimands are; (b) how investigators can choose appropriate estimands for their own trials; and (c) how estimands can be used to guide choices on trial design and analysis strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Kaspar Rufibach (Roche)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the oncology estimand WG: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oncoestimand.org&#34;&gt;http://www.oncoestimand.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on Kaspar: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kasparrufibach.ch&#34;&gt;http://www.kasparrufibach.ch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title/Abstract: ICH E9 estimands addendum: Old wine in new bottles or a genuine step forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will introduce the ICH E9(R1) estimand addendum and how it helps clarifying scientific objectives in clinical trials (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ich.org/)&#34;&gt;https://www.ich.org/)&lt;/a&gt;. Using real hematology trial examples I will discuss how the estimand framework helps to design trials with complex treatment options such as potential curative procedures or treatment sequence across different phases. If time permits I will also illustrate how the framework helped clarify whether and how clinical trials might need to be adapted in reaction to the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof Stijn Vansteelandt (LSHTM/Ghent University)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Adopting the estimand framework: be greedy, but not too ambitious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICH E9 addendum on estimands is timely and welcome in stimulating data analysts to target simple effect measures, directly linked to the scientific question of interest, as is now mainstream in causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus is vastly different from that adopted in the statistical modelling tradition, which instead uses a statistical model (rather than an estimand) as the starting point of a statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, I will argue that this focus on estimands has the potential to raise the quality of data analyses to another level. It therefore deserves to be more greedily adopted in all data analyses, including those that do not suffer complications due to intercurrent events. I will illustrate this by reconsidering the longstanding problem of whether and how to adjust for baseline covariates in randomised clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will next caution for one major drawback of the estimand framework: that it enables researchers to target questions about which the data carry little or no information. In the second part of the talk, I will therefore caution for the use of overly ambitious estimands. I will illustrate this with a proposal on how to deal with complications due to rescue treatment in randomised clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research and clinical trials for gene therapies pose many specific challenges. These can be due to comparing potentially curative treatments to a standard of care with different modes of action or even no currently available treatments. There may also be small sample sizes due to rare or ultra-rare diseases. The talks in this webinar will cover challenges related to study design, including estimands, and use of real-world data and evidence to supplement clinical trial data. Case studies of such challenges will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The FDA Real-World Evidence (RWE) Framework was published in Dec. 2018, shedding some light on how Real-World Data (RWD) can be used to support regulatory decision making. This guidance was greatly welcomed in an environment that focuses on efficiency and innovative trial designs. Yet, three years out, there are not many examples of RWE in practice, especially of situations where RWE is the exclusive source of evidence supporting new drug indications. Recently, tacrolimus was approved for Lung transplantation based solely on RWE and we would like to share our experience with statisticians in the pharmaceutical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three stakeholders – the sponsor, RWD vendor and FDA - will share their experiences of the submission and approval process. Topics to be covered include relevant project background &amp;amp; context, identification/selection of RWD, study design &amp;amp; key analysis methods, operational considerations related to study conduct &amp;amp; quality, submission content and labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, with the wide availability of computing power, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have made it possible to perform inference on complex Bayesian hierarchical models with many parameters. However, a lesser known but equally powerful framework for Bayesian inference based on Laplacian approximations also offers substantial advantages to the practitioner. Using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations or INLA, it is often possible to obtain accurate and much faster inferences (frequently &amp;gt; 100x faster) by calculating very close approximations for posterior distributions of model parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will begin with quick basics Approximate Bayesian Inference, then proceed to building an intuition for INLA from first principles. Details of posterior and predictive distribution calculations will be illustrated, along with necessary assumptions. All through, no prior expertise is assumed, and the emphasis will be on intuition rather than formulae. We then evaluate the real-world performance of MCMC and INLA on actual (anonymized) clinical trial datasets. Continuous, Binary, Repeated Measures and Time-to-Event endpoints will be explored with an example for each. Estimates of parameters, residuals and quality of fit will be compared along with compute times needed for MCMC and INLA. The talk will end with a discussion of the pros and cons of each approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recent deep learning models have achieved impressive predictive performance by learning complex functions of many variables, often at the cost of interpretability. In this talk, I will begin with a discussion on defining interpretable machine learning in general and describe our agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD) method to interpret neural networks. ACD attributes importance to features and feature interactions for individual predictions and has brought insights to NLP/computer vision problems and can be used to directly improve generalization in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then focus on scientific interpretable machine learning. Building on ACD&amp;rsquo;s extension to the scientifically meaningful frequency domain, an adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD) interpretation method is developed. AWD is shown to be both outperforming deep neural networks and interpretable in two prediction problems from cosmology and cell biology. Finally, I will address the need to quality-control the entire data science life cycle to build any model for trustworthy interpretation and introduce our Predictabiltiy Computability Stability (PCS) framework for such a data science life cycle&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Precision cancer medicine envisions a world where diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities are intelligently tailored to individual patient needs. Achieving this vision necessitates access to high quality, accurate, and individualized information about disease state. Engineered probes that sense disease activity — dynamically and directly within the body — could provide this information by generating signals that functionally measure the state of one’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss my work in engineering a novel class of nanoscale sensors that directly query tumor microenvironments by measuring the activity of proteases, enzymes directly involved in all functional hallmarks of cancer. I will share how we can leverage the rich, functional data generated by these sensors to design and deploy novel, expressive, and high-fidelity machine learning models to power individualized diagnostic decision-making and noninvasive monitoring. Finally, I show how we can engineer sensors to spatially profile protease activity in situ, demonstrating their ability to discover personalized insights into mechanisms of tumor progression and treatment response and encouraging their translation for precision cancer medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to use real-world data (RWD), including electronic health records (EHR) and medical claims data, have exploded over the past decade. The Covid-19 pandemic has provided a particularly dramatic illustration of the potential value of RWD for advancing medical research as well as the high-risk of bias inherent to many such studies. Using data sources that were not collected for research purposes comes at a cost, and naïve use of these data without considering their complexity and imperfect quality can lead to biased inference. While RWD offer the opportunity to generate timely evidence grounded in real-world populations and clinical practice, issues of information bias and confounding create serious threats to the validity of these studies. The statistician is faced with a quandary: how to effectively utilize RWD to advance research without compromising best practices for principled data analysis. In this talk I will use examples from my research on methods for the analysis of EHR derived-data to illustrate how an understanding of the EHR data generating mechanism can inform selection of appropriate study questions and development and application of statistical methods that minimize the risk of bias. The overarching goal of this presentation is to raise awareness of challenges associated with the analysis of RWD and demonstrate that valid evidence generation can be grounded in an understanding of the scientific context and data generating process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the single-cell field races to characterize each cell type, state, and behavior, the complexity of the computational analysis approaches the complexity of the biological systems. Single cell and imaging technologies now enable unprecedented measurements of state transitions in biological systems, providing high-throughput data that capture tens-of-thousands of measurements on hundreds-of-thousands of samples. Thus, the definition of cell type and state is evolving to encompass the broad range of biological questions now attainable. To answer these questions requires the development of computational tools for integrated multiomics analysis. Merged with statistical and mathematical models, these algorithms will be able to forecast future states of biological systems, going from statistical inferences of phenotypes to time course predictions of the biological systems with dynamic maps. Thus, systems biology for forecasting biological system dynamics from multiomic data represents the future of cell biology empowering a new generation of technology-driven predictive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The application of established drug compounds to new therapeutic indications, known as drug repositioning, offers several advantages over traditional drug development, including reduced development costs and shorter paths to approval. The development and availability of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular profiling technologies and publicly available databases, in combination with the deployment of the network concept of drug targets and the power of phenotypic screening, provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance rational drug repositioning based on the ability of single or multiple therapeutic agents to perturb entire molecular networks away from disease states in cell-based and animal models. We have previously developed a systematic computational approach to predict novel therapeutic indications on the basis of comprehensive testing of molecular signatures in drug-disease pairs and have leveraged real world data to in-silico validate the predictions. The computational method provides a systematic approach for repositioning established drugs to treat a wide range of human diseases including IBD, preterm birth, Alzheimer’s disease and most recently COVID-19. In this talk, I will discuss the computational methods that we have developed and applied across extensive molecular datasets in order to speed up the process of drug discovery as well as touch on new clinical datasets that we are incorporating into the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Eben Kenah&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pairwise survival analysis and causal inference for infectious disease epidemiology: Causal inference for infectious disease transmission is complicated because outcomes in different individuals are inherently dependent, which leads to interference or spillover of treatment effects. For example, individuals who are not vaccinated are partly protected when individuals around them are vaccinated. An established approach to this problem is to define causal effects in populations (e.g., a vaccination program in a village) and then attempt to measure these directly. An alternative approach is to define causal effects in pairs of individuals and estimate them using methods from pairwise survival analysis. This approach is likely to yield results that generalize more easily between populations, and it allows more detailed mechanistic insight into the effects of interventions. These pairwise causal effects can be used as the basis of epidemic models that allow estimation of the causal effect of an intervention in a population. This approach places greater emphasis on the longitudinal study of transmission in close contact groups than has been evident in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Yang Yang&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Understanding transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases from contact-tracing data: Contact-tracing data provide crucial and reliable information for understanding transmissibility, risk drivers and intervention efficacies for newly emerging infectious diseases. Analysis of such data is often challenging mainly due to surveillance bias, missing data and lack of biological understanding, which have been further exacerbated by COVID-19. We examine several of these challenges: (1) diagnostic bias towards symptomatic infections; (2) presymptomatic infectivity, i.e., the latent period is shorter than the incubation period; and (3) reporting bias, where only confirmed cases are reported but uninfected close contacts remain unknown. These issues, if left unaddressed, can lead to erroneous estimation of key epidemiological parameters. I will discuss our experiences in the analysis of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia several. I will introduce some statistical adjustments we have adopted to address the aforementioned challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional statistical inference and machine learning often appear to be at odds. While simple population models are useful in many contexts, there is increasing interest in using machine learning to uncover complex relationships. This dichotomy has been particularly stark when the scientific quantity of interest is the importance of variables in predicting the response. In this talk, I will discuss a model-agnostic notion of variable importance and general conditions under which valid inference on the true importance can be obtained, even when machine learning-based techniques are used as part of estimation. I will tie this example to general ideas from the literature on causal inference and targeted learning that provide tools for incorporating machine learning into inference on general target parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, the dosing strategy for oncology drugs has focused on the maximum tolerated dose. This has resulted in drugs’ pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and clinical target inhibition largely being ignored. Thus, cancer patients often struggle to tolerate their medication doses long-term, requiring dose modifications including dose reductions and holidays. What’s more, for many oncology drugs, their dosing or schedules have been modified to address safety or tolerability issues after regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges spurred the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence to develop a new guidance called “Project Optimus” to addresses issues relating to dose optimization in clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of oncology drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this shift in dose optimization during drug development mean for the small biotechs that develop more than 80% of novel compounds? And what steps should they take regarding their upcoming clinical trials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this webinar, Certara’s Dr. Julie Bullock will address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Project Optimus may impact clinical trials in the oncology space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the guidance may affect the current oncology drug pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether it may lead to the FDA making other changes in the oncology clinical trial space&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to making sense of the clinical data universe with so many disparate sources of data available in so many different formats is to create a standards-based data ecosystem.  Making true impact involves building integrated data flow through the ecosystem to support automation and data-driven standardized processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Key take-aways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand how data flow is an integral part of transformative biostatistics technologies and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how clinical data and metadata repositories are married with data flow philosophies to create a biostatistics ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials usually involve sequential patient entry. When designing a clinical trial, it is often desirable to include a provision for interim analyses of accumulating data with the potential for stopping the trial early. We review frequentist and Bayesian sequential clinical trial designs with a focus on their fundamental and philosophical differences. Frequentist designs utilize repeated significance testing or conditional power to make early stopping decisions. The majority of frequentist designs are concerned with controlling the overall type I error rate of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis at any analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian designs utilize posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision- making. The prior and threshold values in a Bayesian design can be chosen to either achieve desirable frequentist operating characteristics or reflect the investigator’s subjective belief. We also comment on the likelihood principle, which is commonly tied with statistical inference and decision-making in sequential clinical trials. A single-arm trial example with normally distributed outcomes is used throughout to illustrate some frequentist and Bayesian designs. Numerical studies are conducted to assess these designs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will discuss my experiences coordinating two recent clinical trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that used Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs, and present some methodological innovations to improve implementation and understand the potential benefit these designs offer. I will discuss the ACCESS trial (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03119571), which sought to compare the efficacy of two standards or care: direct admission to the cardiac catheter laboratory versus the ICU; and the ARREST trial (NCT03880565), which sought to evaluate the efficacy of in-transit ECMO-facilitated resuscitation versus standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation. My experiences with these trials motivated methodological research into alternative prior choices and randomization techniques that improve type I error control and reduce the risk of enrolling a substantial proportion of participants to an inferior treatment arm. Building upon this research, we proposed and investigated comparing a set of potential designs in terms of the expected number of failures among the cohort most acutely affected by the choice of design; namely, persons who would participate in the trial if it were open to enrollment at the time they become eligible. I plan to discuss the details and take-aways from this line of research&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biostatistics and computational biology are increasingly facing the urgent challenge of efficiently dealing with a large amount of experimental data. In particular, high-throughput assays are transforming the study of biology, as they generate a rich, complex, and diverse collection of high-dimensional data sets. Through compelling statistical analysis, these large data sets lead to discoveries, advances and knowledge that were never accessible before, via compelling statistical analysis. Building such systematic knowledge is a cumulative process which requires analyses that integrate multiple sources, studies, and technologies. The increased availability of ensembles of studies on related clinical populations, technologies, and genomic features poses four categories of important multi-study statistical questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To what extent is biological signal reproducibly shared across different studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can this global signal be extracted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we detect and quantify local signals that may be masked by strong 
global signals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these global and local signals manifest differently in different data types?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will answer these four questions by introducing novel classes of methodologies for the joint analysis of different studies. The goal is to separately identify and estimate 1) common factors reproduced across 
multiple studies, and 2) study-specific factors. We present different medical and biological applications. In all the cases, we clarify the benefits of a joint analysis compared to the standard methods.Our methods could accelerate the pace at which we can combine unsupervised analysis across different studies, and understand the cross-study reproducibility of signal in multivariate data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the durability of protection afforded by Covid-19 vaccines is a public health priority, with the results needed to inform policies around booster vaccinations as well as those around non-pharmaceutical interventions. In this talk, I will present a general framework for estimating the effects of Covid-19 vaccines over time in phase 3 clinical trials and observational studies. I will show some results on the duration of vaccine protection from the Moderna pivotal trial and from the North Carolina statewide surveillance data. The latter data, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, provided rich information about the effectiveness of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines in reducing the risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death over time. I will discuss the implications of these results for booster vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty about optimality of doses of anti-cancer agents approved in recent years, including PD-L1 blockade agents and targeted agents, has led to a movement in the oncology drug development field to reconsider the traditional approach for drug development.  Following in the path of approvals for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, trial designs for dose finding trials have ballooned from sample sizes in the range of 12-50 to the hundreds or more.  In addition, post-marketing trials have demonstrated that lower doses of certain drugs may be as efficacious as approved doses.  The has contributed to a renewed focus on ‘dose optimization,’ causing statisticians, researchers, patient advocates and regulators to realize the profound inadequacies of traditional phase I dose finding designs. Trial approaches need to incorporate the adaptive nature of a seamless toxicity-efficacy paradigm, while maintaining practical aspects of trial implementation, statistical properties, endpoint measurement and safety and well-being of patients. This talk will discuss these aspects and provide recent context of drug approvals in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Closed testing procedures (CTPs) were originally proposed by Marcus, Peritz, and Gabriel (1976). CTPs were developed to provide a multiple testing framework that ensures strong control of the type 1 error rate. Many of the most common methods used when evaluating multiple endpoints in clinical trials (e.g., Holms, Hochberg, Hommel, graphical methods etc.) can be recast as CTPs. In this talk I attempt to make the closure principle more tangible by using a new algebra-based formulation of the closed testing framework. This approach attempts to ensure that each step in the derivations and proofs clearly follows from the previous steps. Through this approach, we build toward a better understanding of the versatility and usefulness of the foundational principle underlying all CTPs. We provide a framework for understanding how the closure principle controls the type 1 error rate and what we believe to be an accessible proof of how the closure principle strongly controls the family-wise error rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classical-textbook-inference assumes that a model that is used for inference is correct and given before the analysis. Statistical practice, however, includes variable selection and model selection steps before arriving at the inference part. When confidence intervals or hypothesis tests are to be constructed for parameters in a selected model, most likely misspecified, the classical formulas no longer apply in the sense that computed p-values via classical formulas are smaller than they actually are and confidence intervals are too narrow for the intended nominal coverage. The main starting point of selective inference is to condition on the event of having selected the model that one wishes to use for inference. As a tool for valid inference in this talk confidence distributions are used, conditional on the event of having selected a model. Under some assumptions, uniformly most powerful post-selection confidence curves are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Limited access to large-scale, high-quality, and multi-source data is one of the key obstacles to deploying modern machine learning models, which is partly due to the reluctance of information exchange out of privacy concerns. Recent studies have found that data privacy has the potential to grow into a gigantic industry, because of the increasing demand of data sharing, fast development of AI software and platforms, and the vast adoption of data-related regulations and policies. In this talk, we will provide a broad overview regarding the status quo of data privacy, and render more details in differential privacy, one of the state-of-the-art data protection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tipping point sensitivity analysis for time-to-event: a case study in belimumab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will illustrate one way of implementing a tipping point analysis (TPA) for a time-to-event endpoint to assess the robustness of results to the censoring-at-random assumption. The method is based on multiple imputation and it assumes the hazard rate post-censoring changes. A grid of values reflecting such changes is considered to vary the hazard rate post-censoring independently for each treatment arm. The (experimental, control) pairs of post-censoring hazard rate changes form the TPA scenarios. Within each of the TPA scenarios, participants who are censored are imputed a time to the event of interest and are administratively censored if the imputed time exceeds the length of the follow-up. Results are combined across imputed datasets using Rubin’s rules. Finally, the plausibility of the scenarios where the results tip is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Practical use of Tipping Point Analysis in regulatory submissions of clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tipping point analysis (TPA) approach has gained popularity recently as an approach for performing the sensitivity analysis under the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption. This presentation will review why TPA gets popular in clinical trial submissions, its implementation for binary endpoints for time-independent imputation and time-dependent imputation, general procedure of TPA implementation for continuous endpoints, and Interpretation of TPA result based on clinical input. The presentation then shows six real examples of FDA statistical review of submitted NDA/BLAs (all in public domain) that use TPA as sensitivity analysis to illustrate the practical use of this method in real trials and important consideration points from the regulatory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in biomedical research, scRNA-seq datasets with multiple patient samples become common. In this talk, I will introduce our recent research on analyzing multi-sample scRNA-seq data. I will introduce TreeCorTreat, an open source R package that uses a tree-based correlation screen to help explore and visualize the association between samples’ phenotype and their transcriptomic features at multiple cell type resolutions. I will also introduce Lamian, a statistical framework for differential pseudotime analysis with multiple samples. I will demonstrate these tools using both simulation and real data including an integrative analysis of COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Shopify, we have over 1.7 million merchants across over 175 countries, with hundreds of millions of consumers shopping at their stores. We’re focused on leveraging the scale of our data to not only empower Shopify, but to create new experiences for our merchants that are impossible without data. In our daily operations at Shopify, we are highly data informed. Some of the ways we’re leveraging advanced analytics is by building an anomaly detection engine that allows us to process over hundreds of thousands of metric/segment combinations in a very accessible way. In her talk, Dr. Hilal will share key tips on how you can apply machine learning for anomaly detection and forecasting at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASA Philadelphia Chapter Webinar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count data plays an important role in biomedical and clinical research, especially nowadays with the rapid biomedical technique progresses including next generation sequencing. However, using routine statistical model to analyze counts, such as Poisson model, often results in biased or even misleading conclusions. Primary challenges when applying Poisson model to count data include over-dispersion and zero-inflation, which are commonly encountered in practice. In addition, the repeated measures and incomplete observations in modern clinical trials and survey studies add to complexity. This talk will review these challenges in count data analysis and recent methodology progresses made by the speaker&amp;rsquo;s group. In addition, the application of counting process method to the cutting-edge single-molecule localization microscopy image analysis and recently developed innovative statistical methods will also be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monte Carlo algorithms have completely revolutionised statistical computation, allowing previously intractable models to be solved easily. In particular, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have facilitated the application of Bayesian inference in a multitude of settings. One reason for their success is their strong theoretical foundations, which allow us to validate the basic algorithms, provide numerous extensions and generalisations, clarify different options and tunings, and evaluate the results. This talk will present some simple dynamic graphical examples to illustrate the workings of MCMC. It will emphasise the impact and importance of various theoretical MCMC issues including ergodicity, qualitative and quantitative convergence rates, optimal scalings, and adaptive MCMC. It will not assume any previous MCMC background, and is designed to be accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The current pandemic has emphasised the key role that statistics play in understanding what is going on around us.  But how reliable are all these numbers?  How much should we trust what we hear and read?  When do statistics become misinformation?  I will look at the way that statistics can be used to try and persuade audiences to think or act in a certain way, including some utter data disasters, and contrast this with efforts to make communication &amp;lsquo;trustworthy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The time-to-event endpoint is an important data type used in real-world data (RWD) studies. The non-proportional hazards (NPH) patterns and the confounding bias induced by lacking randomization are two main obstacles when dealing with time-to-event outcomes in RWD studies. Previous methods have been proposed to adjust for
either NPH patterns or confounding bias, but no previous work has discussed the simultaneous adjustments for both of them. We proposed a propensity score stratified Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model, which incorporates the propensity score stratification adjustment into the Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model. The proposed method could adjust for both observed confounding bias and NPH patterns, and it is easy to implement and has robust performance in the simulation setting
under different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, our goal is to review different types of Bayesian and frequentist designs that may be used for expansion cohorts in phase 1 trials and in single-arm and randomized phase 2 trials in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– We will start by reviewing the recent evolution and general trends in the design of early-phase trials to investigate the activity of targeted agents and immunotherapy.&lt;br&gt;
– We will then summarize the most salient features of Bayesian and frequentist designs in this setting.&lt;br&gt;
– Finally, we will cover different statistical caveats, including early consideration of randomization, issues related to sample-size calculation and the efficient use of biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Building on the previous webinar series we will present a refresher on the key elements of the estimand framework and use the ETHOS study to illustrate the estimand framework and to highlight the different options that may be of interest to different stakeholders. The background and disease context of the case will be described, the important events (termed intercurrent events) occurring in the trial will be described and three estimands will be showcased. It will then be explored how best to communicate the estimands in medical journals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimands, Estimators, and Estimates – Aligning Target of Estimation, Method of Estimation, and Sensitivity Analysis, with Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENAR members: free; IBS members: $65; Non-members: $85&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICH E9(R1) Addendum on &amp;lsquo;Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials&amp;rsquo; introduced a framework to align planning, design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. When defining the clinical question of interest, clarity is needed about &amp;lsquo;intercurrent events&amp;rsquo; that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest, such as discontinuation of assigned treatment, use of an additional or alternative treatment and terminal events such as death. The description of an estimand should reflect the clinical question of interest in respect of these intercurrent events, and the Addendum introduces strategies to reflect different questions of interest that might be posed. The choice of strategies can influence how more conventional attributes of a trial are reflected when describing the clinical question, for example the treatments, population or the variable (endpoint) of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this seminar we briefly introduce the estimand framework according to the ICH E9(R1) Addendum and describe various strategies for addressing intercurrent events when defining the clinical question of interest. We then reflect on the experience and lessons learned of implementing the Addendum through an internal cross-functional and cross-divisional working group that encompasses various estimand initiatives. Next, we discuss in detail the hypothetical estimand strategy, where a scenario is envisaged in which the intercurrent event would not occur. The Addendum acknowledges that a wide variety of hypothetical scenarios can be envisaged, but it also clarifies that some scenarios are likely to be of more clinical or regulatory interest than others. We share our experiences and try to provide some guidance on their use in clinical trial practice. Finally, we demonstrate how the estimand framework can usefully be applied to clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to address potential pandemic-related trial disruptions and embed them in the context of study objectives and design elements. We introduce different hypothetical estimand strategies and review various causal inference and missing data methods such as multiple imputation and (augmented) inverse probability weighting for the estimation step. To clarify, we describe the features of a stylized trial in neuroscience, and how it may have been impacted by the pandemic. This stylized trial will then be re-visited by discussing the changes to the estimand and the estimator to account for pandemic disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently the UK Biobank study has conducted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of over 40,000 participants. In addition, publicly available imaging genetic datasets also emerge from several other independent studies. We collected massive individual-level MRI data from different data resources, harmonized image processing procedures, and conducted the largest genetic studies so far for various neuroimaging traits from different structural and functional modalities. In this talk, we showcase novel clinical findings from our analyses, such as the shared genetic influences among brain structures, functions, and the genetic overlaps with a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes. We also discuss challenges we have faced when analyzing these biobank-scale datasets and highlight opportunities for future research. This presentation is based on a series of works with members in the BIG-S2 lab of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Our results can be easily browsed through the Brain Imaging Genetics Knowledge Portal (BIGKP) (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bigkp.org/&#34;&gt;https://bigkp.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PSI Sub Group SIG Webinar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar we look at some recent advances in statistical methods for identifying treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. This ranges from identifying baseline biomarkers likely to influence the treatment effect (ranking) to provide novel biomarker &amp;lsquo;signatures&amp;rsquo; (subgroups) with associated estimated enhanced effect (Individual Treatment Effects). Some practical issues ranges from overfitting risks, biases, and confounding of prognostic and predictive effects. Modern methods aim to overcome such potential difficulties while remaining flexible, and offer a structured approach to the problem (aiming to avoid the notorious &amp;lsquo;data dredging&amp;rsquo;). The novel techniques are often tree based and/or penalized regression, i.e., with a machine learning flavour. Sometimes the aim of the analysis is to predict the individual optimal treatment allocation given baseline biomarker data (Individual Treatment Rules). Efficient Visualization of relationships in the data is also of importance in the practical applications. The talks will highlight and discuss such aspects and will also reflect typical aspects discussed within the EFSPI/PSI Subgroup Special Interest Group. (While this event is not intended as a formal course, it will still serve as an introduction and overview to the area, as well as covering some more technically challenging material for the more experienced participant).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People pursuing data science careers default for Tech companies without considering the more classic industries like agriculture, manufacturing, supply chain, etc. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my personal journey transitioning from Tech into AgTech and highlight the challenges many data scientists face who do this transition. I&amp;rsquo;ll close with why data science in these classic industries may be more appealing than opportunities in Tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Adaptive subgroup enrichment design is an efficient design framework that allows accelerated development for investigational treatments while also having flexibility in population selection within the course of the trial. The adaptive decision at the interim analysis is commonly made based on the conditional probability of trial success. However, one of the critical challenges for such adaptive designs is immature data for interim decisions, particularly in the targeted subgroup with a limited sample size at the first stage of the trial. In this paper, we improve the interim decision making by incorporating information from surrogate endpoints when estimating conditional power at the interim analysis, by predicting the primary treatment effect based on the observed surrogate endpoint and prior knowledge or historical data about the relationship between endpoints. Modified conditional power is developed for both selecting the patient population to be enrolled after the interim analysis and sample size re-estimation. In the simulation study, our proposed design shows a higher chance to make desirable interim decisions and achieves higher overall power, while controlling the overall type I error. This performance is robust over drift of prior knowledge from the true relationship between two endpoints. We also demonstrate the application of our proposed design in two case studies in oncology and vaccine trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Matrix completion is a modern missing data problem where the object of interest is a highdimensional and often low-rank matrix. In this talk, I will discuss the application of weighting methods to deal with non-uniform missingness in matrix completion problems. I will highlight some unique challenges associated with inverse probability weighting (IPW)—a standard weighting approach—under matrix completion settings. Then I will introduce our most recent work on matrix completion under general non-uniform missing structures. We draw insight from covariate-balancing methods developed for treatment effect estimations and break away from the IPW framework. By controlling an upper bound of a novel balancing error, we construct weights that can actively adjust for the non-uniformity in the empirical risk without explicitly modeling the observation probabilities. The recovered matrix based on the proposed weighted empirical risk enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. In particular, the proposed method achieves a stronger guarantee than existing work in terms of the scaling with respect to the observation probabilities, under asymptotically heterogeneous missing settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that stimulates a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. It demonstrates characteristics distinct from conventional chemotherapy and stands to revolutionize cancer treatment. We propose a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design that incorporates the unique features of immunotherapy by simultaneously considering three outcomes: immune response, toxicity and efficacy. The objective is to identify the biologically optimal dose, defined as the dose with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. An Emax model is utilized to describe the marginal distribution of the immune response. Conditional on the immune response, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a latent variable approach. Using the accumulating data, we adaptively randomize patients to experimental doses based on the continuously updated model estimates. A simulation study shows that our proposed design has good operating characteristics in terms of selecting the target dose and allocating patients to the target dose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Although individually randomised trials are the gold standard for assessing the impact of new treatments on the outcomes of individuals, they aren’t always possible. In many situations, including when treatments are applied at the group (or “cluster”) level, cluster randomised trials must instead be conducted. Such designs are less efficient than individually randomised trials: larger numbers of participants are required than for equivalent individually randomised trials. Longitudinal cluster randomised trials can claw back some lost efficiency, by instructing clusters to switch between treatments during the trial. Stepped wedge trials are a particular type of longitudinal cluster randomised trial design that has seen a rapid rise in popularity in recent years. In this talk I’ll discuss work investigating the statistical aspects of stepped wedge trials that points the way towards less burdensome and more efficient “incomplete” variants. This work highlights the fact that in stepped wedge designs, not all observations are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s well-known that clinical trials are one of the most expensive parts of the drug development process. Addressable bottlenecks include improving access to knowledge for protocol design such as site selection, assessment schedules, eligibility criteria, and more. As well as clinical trial design, data extraction from clinical literature is also useful for other applications such as competitive intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such extraction, usually done manually, is often tedious and error-prone. Linguamatics NLP is a valuable technology for extracting and synthesizing the high value information that is found in unstructured text. In this webinar, we will discuss the benefits of text analytics and natural language processing over internal and external clinical trial data to optimize clinical trial design and gain knowledge from legacy data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Predictive time series analytics forms a key capability in realizing the vision of trustworthy and performant AI systems in a wide range of application domains from autonomous driving to cloud-native computing systems. Time series data helps capture rich temporal phenomena such as anomalous data trends or faulty system behavior, yet is challenging to analyze due to its high volume and complexity. This talk will highlight some of these challenges with real-world examples and introduce a selection of novel data science tools and techniques for tackling them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall survival or progression-free survival are considered gold standard primary endpoints in Phase III cancer trials but their use in earlier trials has been limited due to the long follow-up time required in most diseases. Instead response to treatment, defined as a certain amount of shrinkage in the sum of tumor sizes, is commonly used in Phase Ib and II settings. Despite this common use, definition of response is very challenging, in particular dealing with multiple lesions, determining the cutoff in shrinkage, the time of response assessment, dealing with new lesions and measurement error due to reader-to-reader variability. The correlation with clinical outcomes and survival is not always as strong as one would expect for a myriad of these reasons. We will present our joint work in this field with a history of 20 years, pointing out to improvements in the field as well as the remaining challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The 2-in-1 adaptive design allows seamless expansion of an ongoing Phase 2 trial into a Phase 3 trial to expedite a drug development program. Under a mild assumption that is expected to generally hold in practice, the trial can be tested at the full alpha level with or without expansion. The endpoint used for expansion decision can be the same as or different from the primary endpoints, and there is no restriction on the expansion bar. Due to its flexibility and robustness, it has drawn immediate attention to academic researchers and industry practitioners. The design has been substantially extended in the literature and successfully implemented in multiple trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will discuss about decision on the expansion bar as well as various extensions of the 2-in-1 design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A live Q&amp;amp;A and networking will follow after the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In life-threatening/rare diseases, randomized controlled trial often runs into feasibility and even ethical issue. Single-arm interventional trial with historical control (HC) as the comparator, highlighted in the recent FDA Real World Evidence (RWE) framework, provides an alternative approach to assess the effectiveness of the investigative therapy in these challenging scenarios. A roadmap of using HC in clinical trials by DIA NEED team will be introduced and then followed by the discussions on statistical methodologies commonly used with HC. In the end, a few selected NDA/BLA filing cases, where HC was used as the comparator in the pivotal trials, will be presented, providing some practical guidance on incorporating historical data from the stage of trial design to the stage of data analysis. Our main findings and recommendation are published at Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Cox proportional hazard (PH) model is widely used to determine the effects of risk factors and treatments on survival time of subjects that might be right censored. The selection of covariates may depend crucially on the specific form of the chosen conditional hazard model, which is often assumed to be PH, accelerated failure time (AFT), or proportional odds (PO). However, through empirical and theoretical
examples show that none of these semiparametric models allow for the crossing of the survival functions and hence such strong assumptions may adversely affect the selection of variables. Moreover, the most commonly
used PH assumption may also be violated when there is a delayed effect of the risk factors. A sequence of Bernstein polynomials based model is instead presented which provides (i) a smooth estimator of the conditional hazard function and is shown to be a unique solution of a strictly convex optimization problem; making it computationally attractive, (ii) a model that encompasses PH structure, and (iii) large sample properties including consistency and convergence rates established under a set of mild regularity conditions. Empirical results based on several simulated data scenarios indicate that the superior performances of the model and thereby shown to avoid possible hazards of the proportional hazard like assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are experiments performed on human volunteers to evaluate a candidate intervention to a control. Randomizing participants to an intervention arm is the gold standard to causally assess the benefit-to-risk ratio.  While clinical trials require appropriate design considerations and pre-specification of analytic methods, interim monitoring of study recruitment, retention, safety, and efficacy are essential to preserve trial integrity.  To this end, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC, also referred to as a Data Safety Monitoring Board/Committee, DSMB/DSMC) typically comprised of 3-5 experts, including clinicians and a (bio)statistician, serves to safeguard trial participants, assess benefit-to-risk, and provide recommendations to the sponsor (e.g., pharmaceutical company or government institution) based on accumulating trial data.  Statisticians play critical roles on the DMC, the sponsor&amp;rsquo;s study team, and as an independent statistician (receives and summarizes unblinded data for DMC review).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is the industry-standard platform for version control, and GitHub is the online platform for managing git projects. I will give a broad overview of the git application and GitHub platform, with specific applications illustrated with Rstudio. Following the book, &amp;ldquo;Happy git with R&amp;rdquo; by Jenny Bryan, I will show how to set up a GitHub account and connect it to Rstudio, create Rstudio projects that use git for version checking, and manage these projects using GitHub. I will demonstrate key verbs in the git language, including adding files to be committed, committing changes to files, and pushing changes into GitHub. I will also show elementary examples of collaboration with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning Algorithms provide an attractive suite of online learning methods for personalizing interventions in Digital Health. However after a reinforcement learning algorithm has been run in a clinical study, how do we assess whether personalization occurred? We might find users for whom it appears that the algorithm has indeed learned in which contexts the user is more responsive to a particular intervention.  But could this have happened completely by chance? We discuss some first approaches to addressing these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are the gold standard for approvals by regulatory agencies. However, RCT&amp;rsquo;s are increasingly time consuming, expensive, and laborious with a multitude of bottlenecks involving volunteer recruitment, patient truancy, and adverse events. An alternative that fast tracks clinical trials without compromising quality of scientific results is desirable to more rapidly bring therapies to consumers. We propose a model-based approach using nonparametric Bayesian common atoms models for patient baseline covariates. This specific class of models has two critical advantages in this context: (i) The models have full prior support, i.e., allow to approximate arbitrary distributions without unreasonable restrictions or shrinkage in specific parametric families; (ii) inference naturally facilitates a reweighting scheme to achieve equivalent populations. We prove equivalence of the synthetic and other patient cohorts using an independent separate verification. Failure to classify a merged data set using a flexible statistical learning method such as random forests, support vector machines etc. proves equivalence. We implement the proposed approach in two motivating case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Covariate balance is one of the most important concerns for successful comparative
studies (about causal effects), such as causal inference, online A/B testing and clinical
trials. However, chance imbalance may still exist in traditional randomized experiments,
and are substantial increasing in big data. In this talk, we discuss several new adaptive
designs and their advantages. The proposed methods show substantial advantages over
the traditional methods in terms of the covariate balance and computational time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the randomization inevitably uses the covariate information when forming balanced
treatment assignments, the validity of classical statistical inference following such
randomization is often unclear in literature. We derived the theoretical properties of
statistical inference post general covariate-adjusted randomization under the linear model
framework. More important, we explicitly unveil the relationship between covariateadjusted designs and inference properties. We apply the proposed general theory to
commonly used procedures and compare their performance analytically. These results
open a new door to understand and analyze comparative studies based on covariateadjusted randomization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;ACTIV-2 is a major international platform trial led by the NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials  Group.  It was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has evaluated several candidate agents for the treatment of non-hospitalized people with symptomatic COVID-19, with the aim of reducing hospitalizations and deaths.  The design incorporates novel design features including the sharing of placebo control groups, potentially with different placebos for each candidate agent, and a seamless transition from phase 2 to phase 3 evaluation.  I will discuss the design and implementation of this complex trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every pharmaceutical company collects, analyzes, and reports safety data collected in trials and in the general use on their products to fulfill regulations and detect new signals to keep their product labels up to date. While those actions have an indirect benefit for the patient, to truly help them and their healthcare practitioners it is necessary to go beyond the raw data and translate the information into the benefit to risk context, informing risk management plans and specific mitigation actions that are derived from data. The goal of pharmacovigilance should be to minimize pain and suffering in patients who strive to benefit from the medicine prescribed by their physician. By properly characterizing benefits and risks of medicines in appropriate populations and semi-quantitatively or quantitatively estimating whether and to which extent the benefits outweigh the risks one can create tangible context for regulators, prescribers, and patients. This informs specific action plans for the health care provider to optimize the use of the treatment ensuring the right medicine gets to right patient. We will present our experience on some specific examples derived directly from our joint experience in safety and pharmacovigilance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immuno-oncology (I-O) and cell therapy, the frontier of cancer treatment, is a rapidly developing area that brings new opportunities to patients. It is critical to identify optimal dose and patient populations in early phase of trials thus improving the probability of success in pivotal trials. Given the complex mechanism interacting with immune system and patient heterogeneity, the conventional oncology dose finding design may not serve the purpose. For example, it is questionable to believe the monotone relationship between dose level and safety/efficacy, which will likely result in inappropriate dose selection using designs with monotone assumption. Additionally, considering the immune system pathway, designs ignoring the heterogeneity of the patient populations may provide misleading dose decisions, which could be either unsafe or lead to selection mistakes for targeted population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar will provide a review and discussion of innovative designs for optimal dose determination in I-O and Cell Therapy from the following perspectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding focusing on DLT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding considering late onset toxicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dose finding in basket trials with borrowing scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal dose identification design incorporating both safety and efficacy endpoints&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has accomplished unprecedented performance accuracies in settings with big data and large computational resources. In this talk, we explore whether deep learning can be successful in smaller-scale settings, even those where the number of variables far exceeds the number of observations. We show that adding a sparse group lasso penalty to the training loss induces variable selection and drastically improves prediction accuracy. We then introduce skip-connections, which allow us to perform variable selection and architecture search simultaneously. The resulting training procedure only requires tuning two hyper-parameters, making deep learning practical even in settings with limited data or computational resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk describes a roadmap on three key problems in pancreatic cancer imaging solution: early screening, precision differential diagnosis, and deep prognosis on patient survival prediction. (1) Based on a new self-learning framework, we train the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) segmentation model using a larger quantity of patients (≈1,000, four institutions), with a mix of annotated/unannotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated by combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on unannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model that identifies associated vessels around the pancreas. Our approach makes it technically feasible for robust large-scale PDAC screening from multi-institutional multi-phase partially-annotated CT scans. (2) We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask. Our results are comparable to a multimodality clinical test that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients with cysts. (3) Accurate preoperative prognosis of resectable PDACs for personalized treatment is highly desired in clinical practice. We present a novel deep neural network for the survival prediction of resectable PDAC patients, 3D Contrast-Enhanced Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CE-ConvLSTM), to derive the tumor attenuation signatures from CE-CT imaging studies. Our framework can significantly improve the prediction performances upon existing state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. This deep tumor signature has evidently added values (as a predictive biomarker) to be combined with the existing clinical staging system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: salmon;&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) KOL lecture series&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a clinically beneficial and safe dose (or doses) is one of the most difficult and consequential decisions in the drug development process.  Dose justification often relies on dose-response modeling, but parametric assumptions must be made a priori, often with little information, potentially leading to a situation where the chosen model does not fit the data well.  This is particularly problematic in longitudinal dose-response models, where additional parametric assumptions must be made on the longitudinal trajectory of each dose.  This presentation proposes a class of longitudinal dose-response models to be used in the Bayesian model averaging paradigm which can improve trial operating characteristics while maintaining flexibility a priori.  The benefits and trade-offs of the proposed method are demonstrated through a simulation study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Bayesian phase I/II platform design for co-developing drug combination therapies for multiple indications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly common to combine a new targeted or immunotherapy agent with the cancer-specific standard of care to treat different types of cancers. We propose a master-protocol-based, Bayesian phase I/II platform design to co-develop combination (BPCC) therapies in multiple cancers. Under the BPCC design, only a single master protocol is needed, and the drug is evaluated in different cancers in a concurrent or staggered fashion. For each cancer, we jointly model dose-toxicity and -efficacy relationships and employ Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across them for more efficient cancer-specific decision making. To account for the characteristic of targeted or immunotherapy agents that their efficacy may not monotonically increase with the dose, and often plateau at high doses, we use the utility to quantify the risk-benefit tradeoff of the treatment. At each interim, we update the toxicity and efficacy model, as well as the estimate of the utility, based on the observed data across cancers to inform the cancer-specific decision of dose escalation and de-escalation and identify the optimal biological dose for each cancer. Simulation study shows that the BPCC design has desirable operating characteristics, and that it provides an efficient approach to accelerate the development of combination therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nitin will show that Pareto Optimality, a simple and intuitive concept for partial ordering, is very effective in sifting through results of a large number of trial design simulations to identify a set of designs that collectively dominate all other designs for the three criteria of power, cost and duration in an oncology Ph3 trial design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more clinical trials have started adopting the estimand framework in protocols after the release of the ICH E9(R1) &amp;ldquo;Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials&amp;rdquo;.  However, there is currently still a lack of clarity on the role of hypothetical strategies. The addendum recognizes that &amp;ldquo;when using the hypothetical strategy, some conditions are likely to be more acceptable for regulatory decision making than others&amp;rdquo;. However, it is still unclear as to what constitutes &amp;ldquo;acceptable hypothetical conditions&amp;rdquo; which could lead to an interpretable treatment effect.  Therefore, it is of great interest to have a diverse group of experts take a deep dive into this topic and help shed light on considerations of hypothetical strategies relevant to the clinical question of interest.  In this webinar, we will have speakers from regulatory agencies and industry to share their perspectives on this interesting topic and also participate in a panel-discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the rapid increase in the volume, variety, and accessibility of digitized RWD and RWE has presented unprecedented opportunities for the use of RWD and RWE throughout the drug product lifecycle. We believe RWD and RWE will be leading the statistical innovation in healthcare industry and regulatory decision making for the next decades. In clinical development, RWD and RWE have the potential to improve the planning and execution of clinical trials and create a virtual control arm for a single arm for accelerated approval and label expansion. From the product lifecycle perspective, effective insights gleaned from RWE bring about informative relative benefits of drugs, comparative effectiveness, price optimization, and new indications.  Aiming to present a wide range of RWE applications throughout the lifecycle of drug product development, we have written a book &amp;ldquo;Real-World Evidence in Drug Development and Evaluation&amp;rdquo; which was published in February 2021. At the 2021 Boston Pharma Symposium, we are excited to share with researchers Chapter 4 – External Control Using RWE and Historical Data in Clinical Development. This seminar will discuss the recent case studies that adopted RWD and RWE in the clinical development and evaluation from the following perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize synthetic control to support single arm study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize natural history study for rare disease development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize RWD/historical data for label expansion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical considerations of using RWD/historical data in the clinical development&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Constraint Promising Zone (CPZ) design, a new innovation on the promising zone design. The CPZ is a design that is easy to implement, and easy for all stakeholders to understand and accept. It is based on the intuitively plausible notion that any additional investment of sample size at an interim analysis should be contingent on a minimal acceptable return on the investment, expressed in terms of guaranteed conditional power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laboratory data is critical to patient safety and essential for a wide variety of uses from public health surveillance to research.  Despite the fact that laboratory data has been digitalized for decades, aggregation is difficult because of problems with semantic interoperability. SHIELD (Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Lab Data) is a public-private partner with over 70 partners devoted to establishing a national system for “describing the same test the same way, every time.”  Gregory will set out current barriers to laboratory interoperability and the SHIELD Strategic Planning Effort that is currently underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The estimands framework, introduced in the ICH E9 (R1) guideline, facilitates discussions during design of clinical trials to ensure alignment between the key scientific question of interest, analysis and interpretation. In the context of oncology solid tumor randomized studies, commonly performed analyses of progression-free survival (PFS) will be reviewed, with a critical eye on which question they address, using the estimands terminology. The estimands framework will not necessarily change common analysis methods within oncology, but will describe in detail how intercurrent events (such as subsequent therapy) will be taken into account and increase transparency on the treatment effect being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has been rapid growth in the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse the vast amounts of data being generated in all areas of society. ML and AI approaches are increasingly being employed in health research, and sometimes are even explicitly called for by funders. While ML and AI may offer advantages over traditional statistical methods for certain tasks, they tend to use complex algorithms and are often regarded as analytical “black boxes”. Hence these novel methods pose new challenges of statistical literacy for producers and consumers of health research. Such challenges may be compounded by an underlying lack of communication and understanding between the statistics and ML/AI communities. Are statisticians slow to embrace the potential of ML and AI methods, and guilty of trying to protect their role in collaborative research in the face of competition from other fields? Or are they rightly concerned about the fundamentals of robust, reproducible and interpretable research being forgotten in the clamour for applying fashionable methods understood by few? This meeting will explore issues in statistical literacy raised by the growth of ML and AI in health research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, new FIRRMA final regulations have been published to further clarify the definition of “sensitive personal data” which was previously left to be developed by CFIUS. The final regulations clarify the provision on genetic testing in two ways: 1) by focusing the definition on genetic tests and 2) by limiting the coverage of the rule to identifiable data. The final regulations implement CFIUS’s jurisdiction over 11 specific categories of sensitive personal data, including health, biometric, and genetic data. CFIUS now have expanded jurisdiction over U.S. companies that collect or maintain records relating to a U.S. citizen&amp;rsquo;s genetic information, such as a genetic test or individual or family history, which biotechnology or life sciences companies might collect and could lead to CFIUS review. CFIUS will closely monitor biotechnology and life sciences companies that operate in these relevant sectors and identify transactions in which a foreign investment raises a national security concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Airborne Transmission of the Virus SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624airborne-transmission-of-the-virus-sars-cov-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624airborne-transmission-of-the-virus-sars-cov-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists realized soon after the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that airborne transmission, which is by inhalation of small airborne virus laden particles (often called aerosols), generated during human respiratory activities was the main mode of the spread of the infection. The prevailing theory of infection transmission, that it was via the direct contact with much bigger particles (often called droplets), leading to distancing at 6 feet arose from work by Flugge in 1897 and later theory by Well-Riley. Immediately upon the detection of the virus, Dr. Morawska and other aerosol experts recognized that the virus may be transmitted by much smaller particles than recognized by Flugge, over longer distances (as far as 60 feet and further) and lingering longer in the air. This is a major change in understanding and public health implications of virus transmission. WHO guidance was modified to reflect the possibility of virus transmission over longer distances and lingering longer in the air. It is expected that this will lead to changes in public health policy regarding mask usage, and ventilation of buildings and other areas people may gather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ISSI Online Seminar Series: Confident Directional Selective Inference, from Multiple Comparisons with the Best to Precision Medicine</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/</link>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210624issi-online-seminar-series-confident-directional-selective-inference-from-multiple-comparisons-with-the-best-to-precision-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MCB (multiple comparisons with the best, 1981, 1984), comparing treatments to the best without knowing which one is the best, can be considered an early example of selective inference. With the thinking that &amp;ldquo;there is only one true best&amp;rdquo;, the relevance of MCB to this presentation is it led to the Partitioning Principle, which is essential for deriving confidence sets for stepwise tests. Inference based on confidence sets control the directional error rate, inference based on tests of equalities may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA gave Accelerated Approval to Aduhelm^{TM} (aducanumab) for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) on 8 June 2021, based on its reduction of beta-amyloid plaque (a surrogate biomarker endpoint). When clinical efficacy of a treatment for the overall population is not shown, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often used to discover SNPs that might predict efficacy in subgroups. In the process of working on GWAS with real data, we came to realization that, if one causal SNP makes its zero-null hypothesis false, then all other zero-null hypotheses are statistically false as well. While the majority of no-association null hypotheses might well be true biologically, statistically they are false (if one is false) in GWAS. I will indeed illustrate this with a causal SNP for the ApoE gene which is involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid plaque in AD. We suggest our confidence interval CE4 approach instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted therapies such as OPDIVO and TECENTRIQ naturally have patient subgroups, already defined by the extent to which the drug target is present or absent in them, subgroups that may derive differential efficacy. An additional danger of testing equality nulls in the presence of subgroups is that the illusory logical relationships among efficacy in subgroups and their mixtures created by exact quality nulls leads to too drastic a stepwise multiplicity reduction, resulting in inflated directional error rates, as I will explain. Instead, Partition Tests, which would be called Confident Direction methods in the language of Tukey, might be safer to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistical prediction models for estimating probabilities have gained popularity in applied research. An adaptation to a new population can be achieved by calibrating the model to the characteristics of the target population, and numerous calibration techniques exist. In this presentation, I will provide a review of the different calibration approaches used in classical statistics and in machine learning for two-class probability estimation. I will present results of a comprehensive analysis using both simulated and real data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An objective of randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines is to develop evidence for whether and how antibody biomarkers can be appropriately used as surrogate endpoints for accelerating approval and increasing distribution of effective vaccines. I will summarize the COVID-19 Prevention Trial Network’s harmonized statistical analysis plan for generating this evidence based on the analysis of several phase 3 trials. The statistical methods include causal inference methods within the principal stratification, controlled effects, stochastic interventional effects, and mediation frameworks. The webinar seeks to describe the distinct contributions of the different methods and a strategy for synthesizing the set of results. The webinar also considers how the analyses can account for the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which may impact vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring patients&#39; safety in clinical trials is extremely important and is a major responsibility of the sponsors of the clinical trials. Regulatory authorities also encourage aggregate review of safety from ongoing clinical trials, specifically to identify potential risks of adverse events of special interest. Sponsors may decide that a blinded review of safety data can meet these needs while also ensuring clinical trial integrity. A Bayesian methodological framework has been developed that leverages historical data of the background rates of events of interest to monitor and detect potential safety signals using blinded data from ongoing clinical trials. This new method is a two‐step Bayesian evaluation of potential safety signals composed of a screening analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis. The blinded safety teams can use these steps to make an informed decision if any events of interest should be escalated for unblinded review.&lt;br&gt;
To ease implementation and operationalization of the method, an R package called BDRIBS (Bayesian Detection of potential Risk using Inference on Blinded Safety data) and an associated R-Shiny application have been developed. The R-package and the R-Shiny tool are both publicly available.&lt;br&gt;
The first part of the presentation will focus on the methodological development and the second part will feature the BDRIBS R-Shiny application to illustrate visualization and assessment of the events of interest to help in exploration of various scenarios and sensitivity analyses in real‐time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden. The first approach involves obtaining individual patient input on the relative priority of outcomes through preference instruments based on, for example, item response theory or discrete choice modeling. The second approach adapts inverse reinforcement learning to infer physician outcome priorities, allowing for the possibility of errors in decision making. Both approaches are illustrated with practical examples from mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Agent-based models (ABMs) are computational models used to simulate the actions and interactions of agents within a system. Usually, each agent has a relatively simple set of rules for how it responds to its environment and to other agents. These models are used to gain insight into the emergent behavior of complex systems with many agents, in which the emergent behavior depends upon the micro-level behavior of the individuals. ABMs are widely used in many fields, and this talk emphasizes the challenges that arise in the context various risk analyses (e.g., epidemics, invasive species, insurance). Relatively little work has been done on statistical theory for such models, this talk also points out some of those gaps and recent strategies to address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health economics has become an increasingly important discipline in medical research. Bodies such as NICE provide guidance based on health economic evaluation. Much of recent research has focused on using advanced statistical decision theoretic approaches in health economic evaluation studies where the interest is in the analysis of a multivariate outcome comprising of clinical benefit and associated costs. Missing data on one or both outcomes is common in these studies. The complex structure of the relationships between the outcomes makes handling missing data more challenging in these studies. In this talk the issues related to missing data in health economic evaluation studies will be discussed and novel statistical models developed to handle missing data using a full Bayesian approach will be described, using as motivating example a pilot study conducted at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Real-world data (RWD) have played an increasingly important role in healthcare decisions, for example supporting the design, analysis, and contextualization of clinical trials. In this webinar, we invite panelists from industry with backgrounds in statistics, clinical trials, data science, epidemiology, and health outcomes research to discuss novel applications where RWD can be used to support clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss propensity-score based methods to leverage RWD as an external data source to augment single-arm clinical trials, enhanced extrapolation of long-term clinical trial survival outcomes using electronic health record (EHR)-derived RWD, and enrollment projection for a prospective pragmatic trial design that utilizes RWD. Finally, we tie the three topics together with a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As policymakers and community leaders have worked to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that statistics and data science can play a critical role in protecting public health and determining the best path forward. Moving from theory to practice presents challenges for working with a patchwork of data from many different sources across public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers will discuss how their work in modeling, inference, predictive analysis, and machine learning has been applied to track the spread of COVID-19, drug use, air pollution, and human trafficking. Panelists will explore the strengths and weaknesses of available surveillance data and how to integrate and draw insight from multiple imperfect data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses the history and characteristics of the R software. R began, 20-odd years ago, as the open source clone of the S software. So the story of R has to start with S and with its history. S came from the Statistics and Data Analysis Research group at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that the design goal of S, and so of R, is to support studies in what we&amp;rsquo;d now call data science. The principles resulting from this goal are still central to computing for data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year on after the final ICH E9 estimands addendum was published, we bring estimands to life. Members of the Estimands in Oncology special interest group will describe how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be guided through a case study and interactively deepen the knowledge to gain hands-on experience in developing estimands. You will be introduced to the background and disease context of the case study, the concept of an estimand, and important clinical events (increased dropout rate and crossover therapy) that occurred in the trial and affected interpretation of the results. Using non-technical language and clear graphical presentation of the concepts, you will experience how the estimand framework provides a common language to describe the diversity of patient journeys and why it is important to address the right question in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210601iddi-seminar-practice-oriented-pragmatic-trials-can-integrate-innovations-more-rapidly-in-evidence-based-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments, their regulatory agencies and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies informing the healthcare payers have the ambition of providing patients with fast access to evidence-based innovations in healthcare. The historical split in objectives and responsibilities of the regulators and the HTA bodies can be seen as one of the reasons for the growing evidence gap remaining after the private sector has performed the trials needed to bring their product to the market. Regulators and HTA bodies differ in their recommendations on patient population, comparators and trial endpoints. The confirmatory trials asked by the regulators may not be fit for purpose to perform HTA nor to inform physicians wanting to practice evidence-based medicine. A better alignment of evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers could accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional option is to perform the missing comparative effectiveness trial in the post-marketing phase. Most informative to healthcare decision-makers are practice-oriented, also named pragmatic trials. Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator. Practice-oriented trials lead to real-world evidence and have proven to be practice-changing. A clear pathway towards the realization of such efficient trial methods is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEY TAKEWAYS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient access to evidence-based innovations can be accelerated if practice-oriented trials are timely conducted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such trials have patient relevant outcomes, recruit a broad patient population and have usual care as comparator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitators would be an alignment of the evidentiary requirements of regulators and HTA/payers as well as a framework for an efficient conduct of trials based on coded electronic health records.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>ASA BIOP Webinar: Generalized Pairwise Comparisons for Benefit/Risk Assessment in Personalized Medicine </title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20210527asa-biop-webinar-generalized-pairwise-comparisons-for-benefit-risk-assessment-in-personalized-medicine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A novel statistical approach to the analysis of randomized clinical trials uses all pairwise comparisons between two patients, one in the treatment arm and one in the control arm. Each pair favors treatment (“win”), control (“loss”), or neither. The “net treatment benefit” is the difference between the proportion of wins minus the proportion of losses. Pairwise comparisons can incorporate several outcomes of interest and several thresholds of clinical relevance in the analysis, and as such, they can be used to personalize treatment choices and to assess the benefit/risk of randomized therapeutic interventions in a rigorous yet flexible manner (Buyse 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages and limitations of generalized pairwise comparisons will be illustrated using two typical examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a single time-to-event endpoint, the net survival benefit is a meaningful measure of treatment effect whether or not hazards are proportional. When a delayed treatment effect is anticipated, for example in immune-oncology trials, the net benefit is appealing because it stresses benefits that are clinically worthwhile on the time scale. The test based on the net survival benefit can also gain power as compared to the traditional logrank test if interest focuses on long-term survival differences (Péron 2016a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anticancer treatment have substantial toxicities that may counterbalance treatment benefits. Generalized pairwise comparisons can be used to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments. This will be illustrated using several randomized trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Péron 2016b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>BSWG KOL Lecture Series: Slamming the Sham - A Bayesian Model for Adaptive Adjustment with Noisy Control Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not always clear how to adjust for control data in causal inference, balancing the goals of reducing bias and variance. We show how, in a setting with repeated experiments, Bayesian hierarchical modeling yields an adaptive procedure that uses the data to determine how much adjustment to perform. The result is a novel analysis with increased statistical efficiency compared to the default analysis based on difference estimates. We demonstrate this procedure on two real examples, as well as on a series of simulated datasets. We show that the increased efficiency can have real-world consequences in terms of the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. We also discuss the relevance of this work to causal inference and statistical design and analysis more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Professor Bianca De Stavola will discuss how life course investigations may characterise the impact of exposures over time (e.g., continuous or time-specific) and across dimensions (e.g., via joint or distinct pathways), and how different study designs may aid them. She will also compare ‘traditional’ approaches to gather evidence for causality and potential areas of intervention with the formality and clarity of counterfactual-based estimands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASA BIOP Webinar: Graphical approaches for the control of generalized error rates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this presentation, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on clinical trial case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer vision application in the medical domain have recently become quite popular. Detecting, localizing, and diagnosing diseases and recognizing structures on MRI, CT, PET, XRay, ultrasound and photographic images is efficiently done by AI. What is rarely discussed, is how these AI systems are made. They require copious amounts of training data consisting of images and human-supplied labels. The labels are marked areas (either rectangles or free-form boundaries) that are attached to a word, e.g. “tumor.” Naturally, only highly qualified professionals are able to provide these labels making the process effortful and expensive. A technique called “active learning” from AI can help with this by reducing the manual effort by 90%. This allows the creation of state-of-the-art AI models for medicine using a significantly smaller budget of time and resources. This talk will present the method with several examples and will argue that this approach is a disruptive shift in medical AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past year has seen a huge increase in the communication of statistical, medical, and public health concepts, methods, and results to broad audiences.  The general public has been exposed to the ideas of reproduction numbers, exponential growth, randomized trials, and the challenges of program evaluation in ways that had rarely been seen at such a large scale.  This webinar will provide a discussion between two experts in scientific communication&amp;ndash;Jenn Dowd, co-founder of Dear Pandemic and Associate Professor at the University of Oxford, and Ed Yong, staff writer at The Atlantic. They will discuss what they have learned during the course of the pandemic about communicating statistical/epidemiological concepts to broad audiences, what challenges remain, and how might we best address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has deeply penetrated the neuroimaging field in the past 15 years, by providing a means to construct imaging signatures of normal and pathologic brain states on an individual person basis. In this talk, I will discuss examples from our laboratory’s work on imaging signatures of brain aging and early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as brain cancer precision diagnostics and estimation of molecular characteristics. I will discuss some challenges, such as disease heterogeneity, integration of data from multiple sites, and derivation of interpretable statistical maps from certain machine learning tools, and will present some of our work in these directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applications of single-cell RNA sequencing in various biomedical research areas have been blooming. This new technology provides unprecedented opportunities to study disease heterogeneity at the cellular level. However, unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including large dimensionality, high dropout rates, and possibly batch effects, bring great difficulty into the analysis of such data. Not appropriately addressing these issues obstructs true scientific discovery. Herein, we propose a unified Regularized Zero-inflated Mixture Model framework designed for scRNA-seq data (RZiMM-scRNA) to simultaneously detect cell subgroups and identify gene differential expression based on a developed importance score, accounting for both dropouts and batch effects. We conduct extensive empirical investigation to demonstrate the promise of RZiMM-scRNA in comparison to several popular methods, including K-means and Hierarchical clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report, nearly 70% Phase II trials failed to move forward to Phase III. Part of the reasons caused such high failure rate could be inefficient trial design and trial monitoring. In this talk, we introduce the concept of dynamic data monitoring (DDM) for ongoing clinical trials. We develop the principles and procedures for dynamically monitoring on-going clinical trials and demonstrate that the accumulative treatment effect can be automatically estimated and continuously accessible over the information time. Building on the adaptive group sequential (AGS) methods, and by taking the advantage of modern eClinical technologies, we developed a clinical trial “radar” system on which the Wald statistics, conditional power, trend, timing for sample size re-estimation, alerting of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility can be automatically displayed. Thus, the trail can be intelligently monitored. Through simulation, we demonstrate the power of DDM in guiding a promising trial to success or detecting a “hopeless” trial to stop. We provide an example of DDM application in the 1st remdesivir trial in Wuhan China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use of open access software, especially R,  is becoming prevalent in pharma. There is a tremendous amount of interest, but many do not understand the basic landscape regarding regulators’ thoughts, the groups that have been working in this area and what has already been accomplished.  This meet-up will discuss this topic from different viewpoints, including an expert from the R Validation Hub (the group that has probably given the deepest thought to this topic), regulatory, and practitioners who have used open access software for submissions in the device field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current pandemic the need to translate clinical data into actionable research to inform patient care has never been more urgent. Using the Precision Medicine Analytics Platform at Johns Hopkins University, a team of clinicians, biostatisticians and information technologists at the Precision Medicine Center of Excellence for COVID-19 rapidly created a COVID-19 patient registry and deployed an array of biostatistical methods to understand patient trajectories, conduct comparative effectiveness research for therapeutics, learn about pathobiology of COVID-19 and implement a real-time prediction model into the electronic health record (EHR). Join this session to hear about the lessons learned from conducting research in real time while building a complex data registry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In modern drug development, the broader availability of high-dimensional observational data provides opportunities for scientist to explore subgroup heterogeneity, especially when randomized clinical trials are unavailable due to cost and ethical constraints. However, a common practice that naively searches the subgroup with a high treatment level is often misleading due to the “subgroup selection bias.” More importantly, the nature of high-dimensional observational data has further exacerbated the challenge of accurately estimating the subgroup treatment effects. To resolve these issues, we provide new inferential tools based on resampling to assess the replicability of post-hoc identified subgroups from observational studies. Through careful theoretical justification and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence intervals and debiased estimates for the selected subgroup treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. We further demonstrate the merit of the proposed methods by analyzing the UK Biobank data. The R package “debiased.subgroup&amp;quot; implementing the proposed procedures is available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will play the part of a sponsor consulting a statistician with the goal of designing a randomized trial with sample-size re-estimation. We will discuss the concept of conditional power and the promising-zone method, and we will present a pragmatic view of some issues, including when to plan the sample-size re-estimation in the course of the accrual, how to select the amount of sample-size increase, and how to operate such trials in practice. We will also discuss the pros- and cons- of using this type of design in relation to the clinical setting in which the trial is designed and endpoints it uses. Moreover, we will discuss the regulators’ views and illustrate our discussion with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic control arms leverage real world data from various sources or evaluations of historical clinical data to demonstrate the positive effects of a new therapy or treatment, without the need to use a placebo or standard of care as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in both the United States and Europe have responded positively to the use of SCAs in clinical development. While implementation of this method for regulatory purposes might be a new development, the majority of statistical and mathematical theories used for the design of SCAs are decades old and familiar to the scientific community. However, synthetic control arm studies are often subject to many misplaced industry myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this webinar our panel of expert speakers from Cytel, Roche and CIOX Health, will share their insights and bust Real-World Data industry myths around the use of synthetic controls in research and regulatory applications. In addition, they will dispel and bust a number of myths related to their specific sector of industry, namely pharma, data vendor, and consulting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first provide a historical overview of the epidemic in Wuhan. I will then provide the analysis results of 32,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the transmission rates using Poisson Partial Differential Equation based transmission dynamic models. This model is also used to evaluate the effects of different public health interventions on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine. I will present the results on the epidemiological characteristics of the cases. The results show that multi-faceted intervention measures successfully controlled the outbreak in Wuhan. I will next present transmission regression models for estimating transmission rates in USA and other countries, as well as factors including intervention effects using social distancing, test-trace-isolate strategies that affect transmission rates. I will discuss estimation of the proportion of undetected cases, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic cases and mildly symptomatic cases, the chances of resurgence in different scenarios, prevalence, and the factors that affect transmissions. I will also present the US county-level analysis to study the demographic, social-economic, and comorbidity factors that are associated with COVID-19 case and death rates. I will also present the analysis results of &amp;gt;500,000 participants of the HowWeFeel project on health outcomes and behaviors in US, and discuss the factors associated with infection, behavior, and vaccine hesitancy. I will provide several takeaways and discuss priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>General Framework for Optimal Data-Driven Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a statistically optimal approach to construct data-driven decisions for stochastic optimization problems. Fundamentally, a data-driven decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization model. The crux of data-driven optimization is that the data-generating probability measure is unknown. An ideal data-driven decision should therefore minimize the out-of-sample risk simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure (and thus in particular with respect to the unknown true measure). Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample disappointment - again simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set, and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that satisfies a large deviation principle. If these conditions hold, we can further prove that the surrogate optimization model generating the optimal data-driven decision must be a distributionally robust optimization problem constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large deviation principle. This shows that the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is, in a rigorous statistical sense, to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this result holds irrespective of whether the original stochastic optimization problem is convex or not and holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. As a byproduct, our analysis reveals how the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust optimization model. This is joint work with Tobias Sutter and Bart Van Parys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The growth of availability and variety of healthcare data sources has provided unique opportunities for data integration and evidence synthesis, which can potentially accelerate knowledge discovery and enable better clinical decision making.  However, many practical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, high-dimensionality and heterogeneity across different datasets, remain to be addressed. In this talk, I will introduce several methods for effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data. Our algorithms are able to account for heterogeneity across different datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms, and examples of implementing the algorithms to real-world clinical research networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpreting how neural networks work is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning. In this talk, I will discuss a novel framework, namely neural interaction detector (NID), for interpreting complex neural networks by detecting statistical interactions captured by the neural networks. Furthermore, we can construct a more interpretable generalized additive model that achieve similar prediction performance as the original neural networks. Experiment results on several applications, such as recommender systems, image recognition, sentiment prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of NID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a pillar of A.I. and has driven most of recent cutting-edge discoveries in biomedical research. In practice, Data Science has a life cycle (DSLC) that includes problem formulation, data collection, data cleaning, modeling, result interpretation and the drawing of conclusions. Human judgement calls are ubiquitous at every step of this process, e.g., in choosing data cleaning methods, predictive algorithms and data perturbations. Such judgment calls are often responsible for the &amp;ldquo;dangers&amp;rdquo; of A.I. To maximally mitigate these dangers, we developed a framework based on three core principles: Predictability, Computability and Stability (PCS). Through a workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) that allows one to manage the whole DSLC, the PCS framework unifies, streamlines and expands on the best practices of machine learning and statistics - bringing us a step forward towards veridical Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we will illustrate the PCS framework through the epiTree; a pipeline to discover epistasis interactions from genomics data. epiTree addresses issues of scaling of penetrance through decision trees, significance calling through PCS p-values, and combinatorial search over interactions through iterative random forests (which is a special case of PCS). Using UK Biobank data, we validate the epiTree pipeline through an application to the red-hair phenotype, where several genes are known to display epistatic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional vaccine clinical development is an undertaking involving meticulous, multiple studies in multiple populations at risk of infection and disease over multiple years. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine development is following this traditional development pathway, but accelerated Phase I-II-III clinical programs are being applied (c.f., USA FDA guidances 2020). This is not the first time vaccines have been manufactured and tested quickly to meet a public health crisis (1976, 2009). Selected statistical concepts pertaining to vaccine efficacy and safety, relevant during the design and implementation of such crisis programs, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this event was to shed light on and explain the main features (pro and con) that surround some of the controversies on use of p-values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Berger (Duke University) has been exploring the Bayesian and frequentist foundations of statistics for 50 years, and has recently been heavily involved in bringing these foundational perspectives to the p-value debate. David Trafimow (New Mexico State University) started the serious questioning of any use of p-values via the journal he edits, and Deborah Mayo (Virginia Tech) has developed a reformulation of frequentist error statistical methods within a full-blown philosophy of learning from error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session I: A Robust Sentinel System for the 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: In response to new legislative mandates and the desire to diversify scientific expertise and enhance core key capabilities in the Sentinel System, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has awarded a new five-year contract that establishes a new organizational structure for the Sentinel Coordinating Center. This new contract builds on FDA successes integrating the active, post-market safety surveillance into regulatory decision-making. This session will feature key leads from each Sentinel coordinating center who will discuss plans on how to advance and transform Sentinel’s data infrastructure into a national resource for evidence generation. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for collaboration to broaden stakeholder involvement, improve access to new data sources and analytic tools, and ensure more efficient and effective safety surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session II: Building the BEST Network and Establishing New Capabilities for the Surveillance of Biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: Launched in 2017, the BEST Initiative enacts the Agency’s mandate to implement active surveillance for biologic products. This session will highlight key achievements of BEST over the last year enhancing its capabilities to execute safety and effectiveness surveillance and inform regulatory decision making. CBER representatives will discuss ongoing work to support the expansion of the BEST data network and methods infrastructure as well as specific studies utilizing the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session III: Leveraging the Sentinel Initiative for COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective: The U.S. FDA’s Sentinel Initiative is engaged in numerous activities to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will highlight key ongoing efforts across CDER and CBER to leverage Sentinel data infrastructure to describe course of illness, and evaluate the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of available COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-proportional Hazards&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations. In this webinar, we look at methods proposed for complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as a candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster Randomization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time. In this webinar, we introduce cluster randomization and stepped-wedge designs to provide an insight into the requirements of more complex randomization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hree Armed Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This “assay sensitivity” problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison.  In this webinar we show a complete testing approach to this gold standard design and how to find the appropriate allocation and sample size for this study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Statistics and optimization are two of the foundational pillars of machine learning, and it is well recognized that optimization provides powerful tools for statistics. In recent years, techniques of the complementary nature, i.e., using statistics to improve optimization algorithms, have become increasingly successful. In this talk, we present several recent works on such statistical optimization methods. First, we discuss how to use statistical hypothesis testing to automatically adjust the learning rate of stochastic gradient methods in training deep neural networks. Then we overview some recent advances in structured nonconvex optimization using stochastic variance reduction techniques. Finally we will briefly explain how to leverage statistical preconditioning to accelerate distributed optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The R language is used extensively throughout the pharmaceutical industry. But its use within the tightly regulated clinical reporting workflows has remained limited. GSK Biostatistics has embarked upon a journey to embed R as a primary statistical analysis tool for clinical reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling R within a global department of over 600 Statisticians, Programmers and Data Scientists is challenging! It requires planning, patience, and a strong foundation that enables consistency across the enterprise. We invite you to learn more about how we achieved this at GSK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about our tidyverse-centric training program, a future-ready Working Area for R Programming (WARP) environment, and a leading-edge R for Clinical Reporting (R4CR) initiative. The goal: help embed R in every-day clinical reporting output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have changed the landscape of genomics research in complex biological systems by producing single cell resolution data at affordable costs. In the state-of-the-arts protocols, a step called barcoding unique molecular identifiers (UMI) has been introduced to remove amplification bias and further improve data quality. Recent literature suggests that barcoding has led to a different error structure in the count data with much less technical noise. Regardless, many tools do not acknowledge the differences between the read count data and UMI count data, still assuming that both suffer from excessive technical noise. In this presentation, I will make a brief overview of scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines and then present extensive analyses of publicly available UMI data sets that challenge the assumptions of most existing pre-processing tools. Our results suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Normalizing or imputing the data set before resolving the heterogeneity can lead to adversary consequences in downstream analysis. As a result, we provide a new perspective on scRNA-seq data analysis by fully integrating pre-processing and clustering, which was classified as part of the downstream analysis. The proposed procedures have been implemented in software, HIPPO. If time permits, I will also talk about other single cell analysis tools developed in my group, VIPER, an imputation method for SMART-seq data, and dmatch, an alignment tool for multiple scRNA-seq samples batch correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard the phrase “X is better than Y for data science”? This is a very common misconception among data scientists, and a very broad definition of data science as a whole. For data science to be impactful, it needs to be credible, agile, and durable. To be able to do this, we need to embrace the differences between R vs. Python. Maybe you prefer R for data wrangling and Python for modeling - that’s great! Why should serious data science be stifled for the sake of language loyalty? Data science teams need to use the wealth of tools available to them to deliver the most impactful results. This webinar will be a discussion among data science leaders, debunking this common myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Almost Matching Exactly</title>
      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200825almost-matching-exactly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will present a matching framework for causal inference in the potential outcomes setting called Almost Matching Exactly. In this setting, the goal is to match treatment and control units on as many covariates as possible. We use machine learning on a hold-out training set to learn which variables are more important to match on; in essence, the method learns a distance metric for matching. This way, our methods retain the interpretability of matching, but also use distance metrics that are automated rather than being hand-designed, and are adaptive to the data rather than being fixed. The key constraint is that units are always matched on a set of covariates that together can predict the outcome well. Our techniques for discrete variables are called Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME), Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME), Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS), and Adaptive Hyper-boxes. FLAME and DAME match units on a weighted Hamming distance for discrete variables using techniques that are natural for query processing in database management. FLAME rapidly produces high quality matched groups for discrete data, even for datasets that are too large to fit in memory. DAME produces higher quality matched groups than FLAME, but is slower. MALTS is useful for continuous variables and learns distance metrics that stretch the covariates in an interpretable way. Adaptive hyper-boxes can gracefully handle both discrete and continuous covariates flexibly and interpretably by optimizing a box around each treatment unit. These methods rival black box machine learning methods in their estimation accuracy but have the benefit of being interpretable and easier to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://master--youthful-lamport-190a0e.netlify.app/webinar/20200813testthat-3-0-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some of the major changes coming in testthat 3.0.0. The biggest new idea in testthat 3.0.0 is the idea of an edition. You must deliberately choose to use the 3rd edition, which allows us to make breaking changes without breaking old packages. testthat 3e deprecates a number of older functions that we no longer believe are a good idea, and tweaks the behaviour of expect_equal() and expect_identical() to give considerably more informative output (using the new waldo package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testthat 3e also introduces the idea of snapshot tests which record expected value in external files, rather than in code. This makes them particularly well suited to testing user output and complex objects. I&amp;rsquo;ll show off the main advantages of snapshot testing, and why it&amp;rsquo;s better than our previous approaches of verify_output() and expect_known_output().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over a bunch of smaller quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to test reporting and improvements to expect_error(), expect_warning() and expect_message().&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the right dose in Phase 2 gives a potential new therapy its best chance to demonstrate efficacy during Phase 3. A well-executed dose-ranging trial therefore has the potential to alter the course of the entire clinical development program. This webinar demonstrates how adaptive and Bayesian techniques can be implemented for optimal dose-finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In social science we learn from stories.  The best stories are anomalous and immutable.  We shall briefly discuss the theory of stories, the paradoxical nature of how we learn from them, and how this relates to forward and reverse causal inference.  Then we will go through some stories of applied causal inference and see what lessons we can draw from them.  We hope this talk will be useful as a model for how you can better learn from own experiences as participants and consumers of causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Survival Analysis Designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-proportional hazards and other complex survival curves have become of increasing interest, due to being commonly seen in immunotherapy development. This has led to interest in assessing the robustness of standard methods and alternative methods that better adapt to deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at power analysis assuming complex survival curves and the weighted log-rank test as one candidate model to deal with a delayed survival effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepped-Wedge designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cluster-randomized designs are often adopted when there is a high risk of contamination if cluster members were randomized individually. Stepped-wedge designs are useful in cases where it is difficult to apply a particular treatment to half of the clusters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will introduce stepped-wedge designs and provide an insight into the more complex, flexible randomization schedules available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MAMs designs provide the ability to assess more treatments in less time than could be done with a series of two-arm trials and can offer smaller sample size requirements when compared to that required for the equivalent number of two-arm trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we will look at the design of a Group Sequential MAMS design and explore its design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Natural Experimental Designs to Triangulate the Impact of a Policy Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal effects is best done using randomized controlled trials. Regrettably, for many policy-relevant questions only observational data are available. In this talk we explore how (i) decomposing a policy into multiple parts, and (ii) leveraging multiple study designs can produce stronger, more defensible causal estimates.&lt;br&gt;
We explore these statistical concepts through an example from health outcomes research: The feasibility and effectiveness of delaying surgery to transfer patients with acute type A aortic dissection—a catastrophic disease that requires prompt intervention—to higher-volume aortic surgery hospitals is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that regionalizing care at high-volume hospitals for acute type A aortic dissections will lower mortality. We decomposed this hypothesis into subparts, investigating the isolated effect of transfer and the isolated effect of receiving care at a high-volume versus a low-volume facility. We used a preference-based instrumental variable design to address unmeasured confounding and matching to separate the effect of transfer from volume. We used the carefully deployed instrumental variable design, and contrast it with a decomposed propensity score study design, to gain deeper insights into the elements giving rise to confounding. We also develop a simple, but complete, form of sensitivity analysis to bound the effect of censored observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4 key learnings attendees will take away from this webinar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of good design of experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider Bayesian statistics to answer your question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P-values is not always what you’re looking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a life-cycle over the long-run, not just study by study&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we’ll show you an easy way teams can solve these problems using proactive email notifications through the blastula and gt packages, and how RStudio pro products can be used to scale out those solutions for enterprise applications. Dynamic emails are a powerful way to meet decision makers where they live - their inbox - while displaying exactly the results needed to influence decision-making. Best of all, these notifications are crafted with code, ensuring your work is still reproducible, durable, and credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll demonstrate how this approach provides solutions for data quality monitoring, detecting and alerting on anomalies, and can even automate routine (but precisely formatted) KPI reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptations to tumor response and progression criteria for immune therapies. Survival may be the endpoint of choice for clinical trials in some tumor types, but presence of delayed treatment effects and non-proportional hazards may complicate evaluation of treatment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical methods to best describe and test for treatment effects in immuno-oncology randomized clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Causal Inference in the Light of Drug Repurposing for SARS-CoV-2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (drugs, knockouts, overexpression, etc.) in biology. In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the development of a framework that integrates observational and interventional data and allows predicting the effect of yet unseen interventions or transporting the effect of interventions observed in one context to another. I will present a framework for causal structure discovery based on such data and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable in this setting. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
