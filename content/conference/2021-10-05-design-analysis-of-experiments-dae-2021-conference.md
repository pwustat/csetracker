DAE 2021 is the 11th event in the DAE conference series. It will focus on emerging areas of research in experimental design, as well as novel innovations in traditional areas. A salient feature of the DAE series is pairing of senior and junior researchers for mentoring purposes and DAE 2021 will follow this tradition in a virtual mode.
