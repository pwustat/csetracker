useR! is an annual nonprofit conference organized by R community volunteers and supported by the R Foundation. Attendees include R developers and users who are data scientists, business intelligence specialists, analysts, statisticians from academia and industry, and students. The conferences showcase applications of R software and developments in the software itself, as well as new and updated R packages that provide boundless additional functionality to R. Community contributions form the foundation of useR! conferences.
