In a market that is constantly adapting and adjusting to the needs of the healthcare field, real-world evidence (RWE) is increasingly becoming important for regulatory and reimbursement decision-making. RWE, in relation to the real-world data that is collected in combination with the advancement of artificial intelligence-based analytics platforms, has led to the real-time analysis of data to better understand and gain insights on disease, approaches to treatment, and how to substantiate coverage decisions. Historically used for post-market safety monitoring, RWE is now becoming integrated throughout the product development lifecycle. DIAâ€™s Real-World Evidence Conference will explore new and innovative applications of RWE and deliver cutting-edge insights through successful use cases, case examples, and practical applications on how stakeholders are leveraging RWE to advance healthcare knowledge and decision-making.
