Designs of clinical trials with time to event primary endpoints usually rely on hazards being constant over time. A major challenge in immuno-oncology is the delayed onset of benefit with such therapies and the presence of non-proportional hazards. The impact of this needs to be accounted for in sample size calculations, analysis methodology and reporting. In this meeting we will examine possible strategies to handle such features, which may not be fully known when the trial is initiated.
