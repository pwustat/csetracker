"Regression diagnostics" are methods for determining whether a regression model fit to data adequately represents the data. This workshop will present diagnostics for linear models fit by least squares, for generalized-linear models fit by maximum likelihood, for linear and generalized-linear mixed-effects models, and for linear regression models estimated by instrumental variables.  

The topics below don't precisely correspond to the eight hours of the workshop; in particular, the earlier topics will likely take more time than the later ones.  

1) Introduction and review of the normal linear model  

2) Examining and transforming regression data  

3) Unusual data: Outliers, leverage, and influence  

4) The response: Non-normality and nonconstant error variance  

5) Lack-of-fit: Detecting and correcting nonlinearity  

6) Diagnostics for generalized linear models  

7) Diagnostics for mixed-effects models and instrumental-variables estimation  

8) Collinearity diagnostics and wrap-up.  

Although they will be quickly reviewed, primarily to establish notation and basic results, I assume some familiarity with the various regression models covered in the workshop. Primarily to establish notation and basic results, I prepared a brief review of these topics https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Courses/SORA-TABA/Review.pdf; please read the review prior to the workshop.  

I’ll use the R statistical computing environment for the presentation, and so I also assume some familiarity with R; you’ll find introductory material on R along with a variety of references and links to resources at http://tinyurl.com/ICPSR-R-course.  

The workshop is largely based on two sources: Fox, Regression Diagnostics, Second Edition (Sage, 2020) https://tinyurl.com/RegDiag, and Fox and Weisberg, An R Companion to Applied Regression, Third Edition (Sage, 2019) https://tinyurl.com/rcompanion. You need not have access to these books to follow the workshop, however.  

Materials for the workshop will be available in advance at https://tinyurl.com/SORA-TABA-diagnostics.
