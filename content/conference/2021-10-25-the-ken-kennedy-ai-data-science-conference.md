Data science is rapidly evolving as an essential interdisciplinary field, where advances often result from combinations of ideas from several disciplines. This annual conference is for professionals and practitioners working in machine learning, deep learning, data mining, artificial intelligence, or big data problems broadly. Recognizing that discovery and innovation happens at interfaces of disciplines and communities, the conference aims to bring together a diverse set of people from multiple communities spanning academia and industry.  

The conference will strike a balance between applied and fundamental data science, and academia and industry. This combination of research and application discussion will create a venue for networking, collaboration, and partnership building.
