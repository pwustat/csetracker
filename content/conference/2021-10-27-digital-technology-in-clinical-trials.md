Digital technology is transforming the drug development process. The rise of wearable and mobile technologies along with cloud technology, Artificial Intelligence and related platforms, now enable the collection of frequent, specific, and multidimensional data throughout the length of trials. These technologies have the potential to enable innovative trial designs, improve the patient experience, act as recruitment and retention tools, and establish novel end points in clinical studies.  

With these technologies, large amounts of data are collected. How to best address evaluating fit-for-purpose, standardization, ethical concerns, and regulatory approaches, are key issues to address in the digital era.  

DIAâ€™s Digital Technology in Clinical Trials Conference will bring together thought leaders from regulatory agencies, biotech, pharma, patients, and academia to discuss the latest advances, challenges, and forward-thinking approaches for implementing digital technology to improve clinical trials. While the conference will focus on the impact of digitalization in clinical trials today, we will make time to explore future applications and how they may enable the clinical trials of tomorrow.
