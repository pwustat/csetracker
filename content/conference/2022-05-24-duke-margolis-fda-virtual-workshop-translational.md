- Present efforts from FDA, NIH, academia, patient groups, and industry to support surrogate endpoint and other biomarker identification and development for use in therapeutic development and regulatory submissions  
- Provide successful examples of using translational science in the development of therapeutics  
- Identify current challenges and opportunities in developing innovative drug development tools and applying them in therapeutic development  
- Foster interaction and discussion among the stakeholders who are developing these tools and implementing them in therapeutic development programs
