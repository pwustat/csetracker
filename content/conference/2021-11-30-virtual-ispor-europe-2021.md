The conference theme for Virtual ISPOR Europe 2021 is “Emerging Frontiers and Opportunities: Special Populations and Technologies.” In recent years, rare diseases, digital therapeutics, personalized medicine, cell and gene therapies, and other new therapeutic approaches have stretched our data and methodological capabilities. Furthermore, issues associated with these special populations and technologies have important implications for a range of healthcare decisions, from regulatory pathways to coverage, reimbursement, and shared clinical decision making. Virtual ISPOR Europe 2021 will feature HEOR scientists and stakeholders who work on these key challenges and highlight innovative solutions, advances in HEOR, as well as examples of how partnerships and dialogue with other disciplines are contributing to address these issues.
