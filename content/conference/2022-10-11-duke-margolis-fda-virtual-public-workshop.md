Speakers from FDA and MITRE will provide an overview of the prototype’s aims, core functions, and role in FDA’s ongoing efforts to modernize REMS. Patients, prescribers, pharmacists, health system representatives, informaticists, and other key stakeholders will participate in a series of moderated panel discussions that focus on how the prototype can address challenges associated with integrating REMS requirements into clinical workflows to facilitate safe medication use.
