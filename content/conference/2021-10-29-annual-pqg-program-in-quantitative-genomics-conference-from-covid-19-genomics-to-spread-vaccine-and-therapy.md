Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coron-aVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread to over 200 countries across all habitable continents, resulting in hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths.  Although significant progress has been made on understanding the genetic and genomic underpinning of the disease and developing therapeutics and vaccines, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Examples includes the emergence of virus variants, how they spread, how the immune system responds, the impact of new variants on vaccines, the roles of host genetics and physiology on determining the disease infection and clinical course of the disease progression, and the long-term effects of the disease. The 2021 PQG conference will focus on the quantitative methods and experimental strategies to address these critical challenges in COVID-19 genomics.  

Specifically, the conference will be centered on the following three topics:  

- SESSION I: Viral Genomics and Phylogenetics  
- SESSION II: SarsCov2 and the Host  
- SESSION III: Vaccine Genomics and Virology
