The Sentinel Initiative was launched in response to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) and is comprised of several components including the Sentinel System, the Active Risk Identification and Analysis System, the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety Initiative, and FDA Catalyst. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is committed to facilitating stakeholder engagement on approaches to modernize the Sentinel Initiative’s capabilities.   

The annual public workshop is a gathering of the Sentinel community and leading experts to share recent developments within the Sentinel Initiative, provide training on the Sentinel System’s tools and data infrastructure, and promote engagement and collaboration with patients, industry, academia, and consumers. The 13th Annual Sentinel Initiative Public Workshop will convene on November 8-9, 2021, and is hosted by the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy under a cooperative agreement with the FDA. The workshop will be held as a virtual webinar and will provide an opportunity for attendees to discuss recent achievements and developments as well as engage with the broader community of patients, consumers, and scientific stakeholders.  

This year’s meeting will feature a keynote by FDA’s Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, as well as presentations from numerous expert panelists who will provide updates on key Sentinel Initiative developments, milestones, and strategic aims. The discussion will also consider recent activities and applications of the Sentinel Initiative as part of the U.S. FDA’s efforts to protect and promote public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
