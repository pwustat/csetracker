The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. News organizations are increasingly embracing data journalism and including effective infographics as part of their reporting, while in research we increasingly rely on data visualization to assess data quality and describe and defend our findings. This year's Zelen symposium brings together data visualization experts and developers of some of the most widely used data visualization software to share their thoughts and ideas with us.
