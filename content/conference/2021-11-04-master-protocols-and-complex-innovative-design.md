The evolution of clinical trial designs has accelerated since the onset of the pandemic to meet patient and logistical need. While elements of randomized control trials remain a gold standard, clinical trials continue to transform, building on innovations in study design and statistical approaches, as well as regulatory flexibilities, with the promise of bringing new medicines to patients more quickly than ever.  

Supported by advancement in clinical trail operations, development of digital technologies along with strong partnerships and collaborations amongst key stakeholders, clinical trials are poised to reach more people and add efficiency to clinical drug development. Master protocol and complex innovative designs continue to provide frameworks that hold enormous promise for engaging patients more productively, increasing overall efficiency and improving successful outcomes.  
 
DIAâ€™s Master Protocols and Complex Innovative Design Meeting will bring together a truly multidisciplinary group of experts in clinical trial planning, execution, and analysis to share and discuss both the common and unique challenges and opportunities in the adoption of master protocols and complex innovative design. Join industry, patient, regulatory agency, other government, and NGO representatives to examine the growing body of knowledge, experience, and resources available to better meet patient needs through successful implementation of innovation in clinical trial designs.
