FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) launched Project Orbis in May 2019 with international regulatory authorities as a global collaborative review program for oncology marketing applications. Current Project Orbis partners include the regulatory health authorities of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The program aims to facilitate the submission, review, and approval of high impact oncology marketing applications across the participating countries.  

Learning Objectives:  
- Discuss the general framework of Project Orbis.  
- Explain how other FDA and OCE review programs interact with Project Orbis.
