Imaging plays an important role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and pharmaceutical Research & Development. For decades, innovative statistical methods have been applied to various biomedical image modalities. In the past 10 years, deep learning and AI have begun increasingly dominating this field. Currently, biomedical image analysis has become an extremely complex area, because of the diversity both in image modality and the analysis methodology.  This meetup attempts to provide a snapshot of this vital interdisciplinary area with three talks, delivered from speakers with either academic or industrial backgrounds.
