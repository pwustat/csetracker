Artificial intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential to improve prediction of health risks and health  outcomes. The Biomedical AI and Data Sciences seminar series aims to initiate a dialog between healthcare practitioners, clinical researchers, and AI and Data Science experts on strategies for realizing the promise and potential of AI in healthcare.  

The series kicks off on June 8 with several lightning talks from Penn State researchers, followed by discussions about the topics discussed, and next steps. In fall 2021, the series will continue and will feature prominent researchers within and beyond Penn State who are leading foundational and translational research on AI in healthcare.
