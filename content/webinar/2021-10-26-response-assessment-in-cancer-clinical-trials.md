Overall survival or progression-free survival are considered gold standard primary endpoints in Phase III cancer trials but their use in earlier trials has been limited due to the long follow-up time required in most diseases. Instead response to treatment, defined as a certain amount of shrinkage in the sum of tumor sizes, is commonly used in Phase Ib and II settings. Despite this common use, definition of response is very challenging, in particular dealing with multiple lesions, determining the cutoff in shrinkage, the time of response assessment, dealing with new lesions and measurement error due to reader-to-reader variability. The correlation with clinical outcomes and survival is not always as strong as one would expect for a myriad of these reasons. We will present our joint work in this field with a history of 20 years, pointing out to improvements in the field as well as the remaining challenges.
