In modern statistics, interests shift from pursuing the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator to reducing mean squared error (MSE) or residual squared error. However, the characterization of such optimal statistics in terms of minimizing MSE remains open and challenging in many problems, for example estimating treatment effect in adaptive clinical trials with pre-planned modifications to design aspects based on accumulated data. From an alternative perspective, we propose a deep neural network based automatic method to construct an improved estimator from existing ones. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method has considerable finite-sample efficiency gain as compared with several common estimators. In the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) as an important application, our ensemble estimator essentially contributes to a more ethical and efficient adaptive clinical trial with fewer patients enrolled.
