The US Food and Drug Administration increasingly emphasizes the importance of assessing how patients “feel, function, and survive” when evaluating new treatments in clinical trials, often via the use of endpoints derived from patient-reported outcome measures (PROs). This presentation examines possible pitfalls in using PRO-derived endpoints to estimate and test hypotheses about treatment effects. It discusses the notion of whether endpoints possess “causal inference validity,” and presents inferential remedies when such validity is not achieved. The pitfalls and remedies are exemplified in a simulation study using the Rasch item response theory measurement model to analyze a PRO.
