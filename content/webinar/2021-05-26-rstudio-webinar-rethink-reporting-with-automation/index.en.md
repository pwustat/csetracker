We invite you to join Claudio Rebelo, Actuary at Swiss Re, to learn about how companies in every industry, but especially in insurance, can revolutionize their reporting capabilities with automation.  

You’ll learn about his team’s journey transitioning from a reporting frankenstack, involving SAS, Excel, and SQL, to a more effective way with free, open-source tools like R Markdown.
