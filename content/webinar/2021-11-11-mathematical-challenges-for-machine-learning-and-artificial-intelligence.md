<span style="color: salmon;">*National Academies Symposium*</span>
<!--more-->
During the symposium, speakers will discuss how statistical theory helps build in protections for black box machine learning models, new approaches for making sense of high-dimensional and heterogenous data, novel methods for understanding causality, and future research opportunities in deep learning.
