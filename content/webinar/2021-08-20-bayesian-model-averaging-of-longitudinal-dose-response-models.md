Selecting a clinically beneficial and safe dose (or doses) is one of the most difficult and consequential decisions in the drug development process.  Dose justification often relies on dose-response modeling, but parametric assumptions must be made a priori, often with little information, potentially leading to a situation where the chosen model does not fit the data well.  This is particularly problematic in longitudinal dose-response models, where additional parametric assumptions must be made on the longitudinal trajectory of each dose.  This presentation proposes a class of longitudinal dose-response models to be used in the Bayesian model averaging paradigm which can improve trial operating characteristics while maintaining flexibility a priori.  The benefits and trade-offs of the proposed method are demonstrated through a simulation study.
