Nitin will show that Pareto Optimality, a simple and intuitive concept for partial ordering, is very effective in sifting through results of a large number of trial design simulations to identify a set of designs that collectively dominate all other designs for the three criteria of power, cost and duration in an oncology Ph3 trial design.
