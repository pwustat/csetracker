<!--more-->
An increasing number of clinical trials show a successful outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies. This has resulted in multiple US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in the last few years. Flow cytometry has become an important tool in these clinical trials to monitor the presence and expansion of CAR T cells in patients. Immunophenotyping of CAR T cells by flow cytometry has provided valuable information to clinicians which helps to further improve the CAR T-cell therapy.  

The featured speakers will discuss the role of flow cytometry in identifying the markers expressed on malignant plasma cells, which facilitates the selection of CAR T-cell therapy. Attendees will learn about the aspects of flow cytometry assays in CAR T-cell and plasma cell monitoring in multiple myeloma (MM) trials. In addition, the speakers will discuss the challenges of developing flow cytometry assays for clinical trials.  

Join this webinar to learn the use of flow cytometry for the monitoring, phenotyping and characterization of CAR T cells in clinical trials.
