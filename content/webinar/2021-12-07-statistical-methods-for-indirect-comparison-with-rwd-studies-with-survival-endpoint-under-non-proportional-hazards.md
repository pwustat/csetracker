The time-to-event endpoint is an important data type used in real-world data (RWD) studies. The non-proportional hazards (NPH) patterns and the confounding bias induced by lacking randomization are two main obstacles when dealing with time-to-event outcomes in RWD studies. Previous methods have been proposed to adjust for
either NPH patterns or confounding bias, but no previous work has discussed the simultaneous adjustments for both of them. We proposed a propensity score stratified Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model, which incorporates the propensity score stratification adjustment into the Fleming-Harrington weighted Cox model. The proposed method could adjust for both observed confounding bias and NPH patterns, and it is easy to implement and has robust performance in the simulation setting
under different scenarios.
