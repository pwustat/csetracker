ACTIV-2 is a major international platform trial led by the NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials  Group.  It was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has evaluated several candidate agents for the treatment of non-hospitalized people with symptomatic COVID-19, with the aim of reducing hospitalizations and deaths.  The design incorporates novel design features including the sharing of placebo control groups, potentially with different placebos for each candidate agent, and a seamless transition from phase 2 to phase 3 evaluation.  I will discuss the design and implementation of this complex trial.
