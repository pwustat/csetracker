<span style="color: salmon;">*R Adoption Series Webinar*</span>

<!--more-->
In this R Adoption Series Webinar, the R Consortium invites the ASA Software Engineering Working Group ASA BIOP SWE to share their experience of how the group formed and the types of problems they are trying to solve in the Open Source for the Pharmaceutical industry.   

This session starts with describing the ASA SWE group, its motivations, and purpose, and then digs into one of the packages that the group has created {mmrm}. The mmrm package will be demoed and discuss why we have to be careful with the development of packages, why it’s not “yet another package,” and then the long-term perspective on software engineering in the Pharmaceutical industry.   

Then, Yoni Sidi will do a demo of the {mmrm} package describing the differences between SAS and R. The last section of the event will be focused on answering questions about this new working group and the {mmrm} package.
