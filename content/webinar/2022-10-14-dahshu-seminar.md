Applications of personalized medicine are becoming increasingly prominent. Examples of successful therapeutics linked to companion diagnostic devices include Vysis ALK Break Apart FFPE FISH Test (Crizotinib), HER2 FISH pharmDx and IHC HercepTest (Herceptin), and cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Vemurafenib). A key component of personalized medicine is the development of companion diagnostics that measure biomarkers, e.g., protein expression, gene amplification, or specific mutations. An in vitro companion diagnostic device (or test) is an in vitro diagnostic device which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. This short course will provide an overview of CDx validation including study designs for both analytical and clinical studies, and challenges. One of such challenges is how to assess the CDx clinical validly if trial assay (CTA) instead of CDx is used to classify patient biomarker status at the clinical trial enrollment in the clinical trial. A bridging study from CTA to CDx is required in order to evaluate the drug efficacy in CDx intended use population. In this seminar, statistical methods for addressing key issues such as biomarker threshold determination, bridging study, prescreening issues, are discussed. The course will also cover the study design and data analysis for follow-on CDx.
