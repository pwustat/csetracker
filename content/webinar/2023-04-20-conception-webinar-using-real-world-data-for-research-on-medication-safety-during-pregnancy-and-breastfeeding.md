Real-world data often refers to data generated by routine healthcare delivery, including electronic health records and claims data, or through patient-generated sources such as wearable devices, social media, and mobile apps. Real-world data has the potential to transform healthcare by enabling more personalized, evidence-based care, while improving health outcomes, and reducing costs. Nonetheless, it also presents challenges around data quality, privacy, and bias, which must be addressed to ensure the quality of the studies.
 
In this webinar, our experts will discuss the opportunities and challenges of using real-world data to investigate the safety of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. You'll learn about the latest contributions of ConcePTION in this field and how studies using real-world data can inform clinical and regulatory decision-making to ultimately improve the health of both pregnant women and their children.
