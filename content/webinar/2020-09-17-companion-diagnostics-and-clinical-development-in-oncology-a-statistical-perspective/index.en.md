This webinar provided a discussion around the need for integration of biomarker and IVD validation in clinical development, with a focus in oncology and companion diagnostics. It highlighted how flawed analytical and/or clinical validation can jeopardize a biomarker’s and drug’s clinical utility and showcase why biomarkers deserved statistical rigor throughout the development and validation process.
