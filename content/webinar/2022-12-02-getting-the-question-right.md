The use of the estimand framework for clinical trial protocols has gained increasing popularity since its introduction in the ICH E9 addendum. The framework facilitates the discussion about the trial objectives and helps to align the clinical research question with the analysis. In this webinar we will discuss the value of the estimand framework for real-world evidence (RWE) applications in drug development. Two case studies will illustrate how the framework can support multidisciplinary discussions and facilitate the dialogue with regulators in a transparent and structured way. Furthermore, the connection with the target trial framework which has been used in epidemiology to ensure that non-randomized comparisons address the causal question interest will be highlighted. Regulatory and payer perspectives on the use of real-world data and the opportunities to overcome some of historical challenges by using the estimand framework will be discussed.

The webinar will include speakers from the industry, academia, regulatory and reimbursement bodies and target a broad statistical and non-statistical audience with an interest in real-world data.
