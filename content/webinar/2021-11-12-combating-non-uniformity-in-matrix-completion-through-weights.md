Matrix completion is a modern missing data problem where the object of interest is a highdimensional and often low-rank matrix. In this talk, I will discuss the application of weighting methods to deal with non-uniform missingness in matrix completion problems. I will highlight some unique challenges associated with inverse probability weighting (IPW)—a standard weighting approach—under matrix completion settings. Then I will introduce our most recent work on matrix completion under general non-uniform missing structures. We draw insight from covariate-balancing methods developed for treatment effect estimations and break away from the IPW framework. By controlling an upper bound of a novel balancing error, we construct weights that can actively adjust for the non-uniformity in the empirical risk without explicitly modeling the observation probabilities. The recovered matrix based on the proposed weighted empirical risk enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. In particular, the proposed method achieves a stronger guarantee than existing work in terms of the scaling with respect to the observation probabilities, under asymptotically heterogeneous missing settings.
