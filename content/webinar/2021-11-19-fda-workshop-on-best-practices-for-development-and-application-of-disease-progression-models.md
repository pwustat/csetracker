This workshop will bring together stakeholders from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies in a virtual setting to discuss the best practices for developing disease progression models and their application to support drug development decisions, share experiences and case studies that highlight the opportunities and limitations in the development and application of disease progression models including models for natural history of disease and clinical trial simulations, and discuss the knowledge gaps and research needed to advance the development and use of disease progression models.  

Some topics of discussion include:  

- Role of disease models in drug development and regulatory review  
- Lessons learned from past experiences of applying disease models in drug development  
- Best practice considerations for disease modeling to support drug development and regulatory decisions  
- Best practice considerations for clinical trial simulations based on disease progression/natural history models to support drug development and regulatory decisions
