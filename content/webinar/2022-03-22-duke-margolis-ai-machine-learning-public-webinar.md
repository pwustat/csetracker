There will be a fireside chat between Jeff Shuren, FDAâ€™s director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CRDH), and Mark McClellan, director of Duke-Margolis, followed by three panel discussions focused on the following topics:  

- overarching frameworks for regulating and evaluating AI  
- good machine learning practices (GMLP)  
- post-market evaluation of AI/ML SaMD   

The webinar will end with a business roundtable discussion on how developers and health care systems are considering these issues.
