The application of established drug compounds to new therapeutic indications, known as drug repositioning, offers several advantages over traditional drug development, including reduced development costs and shorter paths to approval. The development and availability of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular profiling technologies and publicly available databases, in combination with the deployment of the network concept of drug targets and the power of phenotypic screening, provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance rational drug repositioning based on the ability of single or multiple therapeutic agents to perturb entire molecular networks away from disease states in cell-based and animal models. We have previously developed a systematic computational approach to predict novel therapeutic indications on the basis of comprehensive testing of molecular signatures in drug-disease pairs and have leveraged real world data to in-silico validate the predictions. The computational method provides a systematic approach for repositioning established drugs to treat a wide range of human diseases including IBD, preterm birth, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and most recently COVID-19. In this talk, I will discuss the computational methods that we have developed and applied across extensive molecular datasets in order to speed up the process of drug discovery as well as touch on new clinical datasets that we are incorporating into the pipeline.
