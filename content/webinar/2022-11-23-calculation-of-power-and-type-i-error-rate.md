Many methods for borrowing information from historical controls in the analysis of a randomized trial have been proposed, such as the (modified) power prior and the meta-analytic predictive prior. These
methods aim to increase the power and reduce sample size requirements while providing a safeguard against prior-data conflict (i.e. substantial differences between data sources). However some methods can increase the type I error rate, which may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities. Power and type I error rate are calculated using simulation, which can be done using a conditional (taking the historical
data as fixed) or an unconditional approach (sampling also the historical data in the simulation).  

In this talk we give a brief introduction to these borrowing methods and we discuss the ideas behind the unconditional and the conditional approach. We propose a framework for the unconditional approach that
can incorporate a systematic bias of the historical data as well as between-study heterogeneity based on an assumption of exchangeability. In this framework, prior information on the similarity of the current
trial and the historical data can be included. The framework is illustrated using a simulation study. The results of the unconditional approach show that if we assume exchangeability and no systematic bias of historical and current controls, a gain in power while keeping the type I error rate fixed is possible. Using the conditional approach it is difficult to incorporate knowledge on the similarity of the historical controls.
