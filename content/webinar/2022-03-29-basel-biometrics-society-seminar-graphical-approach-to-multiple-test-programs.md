The issue of multiplicity often arises in the design and analysis of clinical trials. Common multiple test problems include comparing several treatments with a control, assessing the benefit of a new treatment for more than one endpoint, combined non-inferiority and superiority testing, or any combination thereof. This short course will be on the graphical approachâ€™s flexible and transparent implementation of multiple testing. Using graphical approaches, one can easily construct and explore different test strategies and thus tailor the test procedure to the given study objectives. The resulting multiple test procedures are represented by directed, weighted graphs, where each node corresponds to an elementary hypothesis, together with a simple algorithm to generate such graphs while sequentially testing the individual hypotheses. We also present case studies to illustrate how the approach can be used in clinical practice and provide relevant extensions.
