Evaluating the durability of protection afforded by Covid-19 vaccines is a public health priority, with the results needed to inform policies around booster vaccinations as well as those around non-pharmaceutical interventions. In this talk, I will present a general framework for estimating the effects of Covid-19 vaccines over time in phase 3 clinical trials and observational studies. I will show some results on the duration of vaccine protection from the Moderna pivotal trial and from the North Carolina statewide surveillance data. The latter data, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, provided rich information about the effectiveness of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines in reducing the risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death over time. I will discuss the implications of these results for booster vaccinations.
