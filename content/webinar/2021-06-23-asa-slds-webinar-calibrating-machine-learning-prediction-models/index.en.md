Statistical prediction models for estimating probabilities have gained popularity in applied research. An adaptation to a new population can be achieved by calibrating the model to the characteristics of the target population, and numerous calibration techniques exist. In this presentation, I will provide a review of the different calibration approaches used in classical statistics and in machine learning for two-class probability estimation. I will present results of a comprehensive analysis using both simulated and real data.
