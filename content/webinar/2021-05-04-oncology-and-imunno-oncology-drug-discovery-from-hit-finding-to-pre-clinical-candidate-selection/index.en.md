An expert from Hitgen will discuss the application of DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology: the mechanics of DEL, the advantages and challenges of the technology to those considering DEL technology for identifying ligands for their target of interest.  

An expert from Oncodesign will discuss how patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and PDX-derived models should be incorporated into different stages of the drug discovery process, taking example of Drug Positioning in Breast Cancer with relevant human projection.
