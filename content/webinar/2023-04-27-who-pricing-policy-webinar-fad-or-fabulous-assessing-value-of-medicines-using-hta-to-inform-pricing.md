Assessing value through Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to inform pricing of pharmaceutical products has been burgeoning in countries in recent years. While the concept of HTA and value assessment are well-accepted, there have been questions about whether pharmaceutical pricing informed by value assessment could be the single solution to bring about timely and affordable access to medicines and incentivize future innovations. Some research shows that prices can be higher than the assessed value in countries with HTA, while others have concluded that there are surpluses to patients and providers. In this webinar, we will explore the experiences with country HTA systems to inform medicines pricing based on the experiences in implementing and establishing HTA processes in Brazil, India and the United States of America. The panelists will describe the achievements, promises and challenges of using HTA to inform pharmaceutical pricing and decision-making, and a moderated discussion will follow to highlight the key themes and ways to move our understanding forward.
