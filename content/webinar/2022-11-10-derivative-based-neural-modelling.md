Survival models — particularly those able to account for patient comorbidities via competing risks analysis — offer valuable prognostic information to clinicians making critical decisions and represent a growing area of application for machine learning approaches. However, current methods typically involve restrictive parameterisations, discretisation of time or the modelling of only one event cause. In this talk, I highlight how general cumulative distribution functions can be naturally expressed via neural network-based ordinary differential equations and how this can be utilised in survival analysis. In particular, we present DeSurv, a neural derivative-based approach capable of avoiding the aforementioned restrictions and flexibly modelling competing-risk survival data in continuous time. We apply DeSurv to both single-risk and competing-risk synthetic and real-world datasets and obtain results which compare favourably with current state-of-the-art models.
