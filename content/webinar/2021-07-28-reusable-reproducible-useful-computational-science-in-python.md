We will cover organization of Python code, packaging with setuptools, installing code in development mode with pip, unit testing with unittest/pytest, linting with black, code quality assurance with flake8, documentation with Sphinx, automation with Tox, continuous integration with GitHub Actions, documentation hosting with ReadTheDocs, implementation of command line interfaces using Click, versioning with bumpversion, archiving on Zenodo, and ultimately, deployment to PyPI. This tutorial will be appropriate for Python programmers of all skill levels and for projects of all sizes.
