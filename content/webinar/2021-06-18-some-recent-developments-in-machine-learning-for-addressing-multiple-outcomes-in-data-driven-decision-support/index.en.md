**Mathematical Foundations of Data Science Webinar Series**  
In this presentation, we will discuss some recent developments in machine learning based precision health for estimating dynamic treatment regimes which seek to balance two or more outcomes, such as, for example, balancing treatment efficacy against side effect burden. The first approach involves obtaining individual patient input on the relative priority of outcomes through preference instruments based on, for example, item response theory or discrete choice modeling. The second approach adapts inverse reinforcement learning to infer physician outcome priorities, allowing for the possibility of errors in decision making. Both approaches are illustrated with practical examples from mental health.
