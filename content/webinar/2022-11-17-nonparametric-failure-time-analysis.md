Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) has become routine in oncology genomic translational research. GWAS often requires genome-wide screening to identify ordinal or continuous genomic features that are associated with long-term treatment outcome; for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with time to cancer relapse. The estimated coefficient of a hazard rate regression model (HRRM, such as Cox’s model) has been a popular choice for a statistic to test for such associations. It will be demonstrated in this talk that in certain circumstances one runs into trouble with the HRRM approach.  

Motivated by this problem, a robust, completely nonparametric approach using Pearson’s or rank-based correlation has been developed. This method, called correlation profile test (CPT), is formed by the correlation profile statistic coupled with an
accurate hybrid permutation test that combines permutation and asymptotic distribution. Statistical performances of CPT are compared with a few established methods by a simulation study and an analysis of a real GWAS dataset. It is shown that
in cases where the proportional hazards assumption does not hold, CPT is much superior to the HRRM approach in terms of possessing higher statistical power and maintaining the nominal significance level. Only in the scenarios where the proportional hazards model holds exactly or approximately can CPT be inferior to the HRRM approach. Some analytical insight into this performance pattern will be presented. In summary, CPT is a complementary alternative to the HRRM approach in testing
associations between two random variables one of which is a failure time subject to right censoring.
