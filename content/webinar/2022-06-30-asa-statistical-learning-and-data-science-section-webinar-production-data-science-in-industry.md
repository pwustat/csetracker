Production data science in investment management is an impactful field where our models interact with capital markets. In this talk, we provide a definition of “production” for data science models, and introduce computational reproducibility and replicability as key considerations that inform production decisions. We describe a representation of model computational workflow using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that can be used to navigate and research reproducibility and replicability. We also provide a view into how available low-code modeling tools enter these considerations via an example of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented for a model used in finance. Finally, we conclude by introducing open research opportunities in the area of increasing automation in data and model selection in production.
