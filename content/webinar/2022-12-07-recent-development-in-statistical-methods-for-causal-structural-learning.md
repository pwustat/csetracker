Causal graphical tools have been widely used in quantitative drug development to understand disease mechanisms, visualize thoughts and verify statistical assumptions. With either clinical trial or real-world evidence data, obtaining the underlying causal graph is always an important problem. Statistical methods for causal structural learning are often used to uncover the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from the data, and causal relationships among variables can be identified based on the estimated DAGs. In this presentation, I will introduce some recent works about statistical methods for Causal Structural Learning. The first part is the DAG estimation with application to longitudinal data. We proposed a novel statistical method to address the within-subject dependency as well as the cross-time causal relationships. We also proposed a condition called subgraph consistency to protect the cause-effect relationships at the current time point from being affected by future variables. In addition, we conducted extensive simulations to show the validity of our method in recovering the true underlying causal structure.  
In the second part, I will introduce the impact
of missing data and imputation methods in DAG estimation. We conducted a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of both PC-algorithm and GES method with different missing mechanisms including missing complete at random and missing at random. The simulation revealed the bias of both methods using complete case data and imputations methods for DAG estimation.
