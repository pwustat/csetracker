In this talk, Professor Bianca De Stavola will discuss how life course investigations may characterise the impact of exposures over time (e.g., continuous or time-specific) and across dimensions (e.g., via joint or distinct pathways), and how different study designs may aid them. She will also compare ‘traditional’ approaches to gather evidence for causality and potential areas of intervention with the formality and clarity of counterfactual-based estimands.
