Every pharmaceutical company collects, analyzes, and reports safety data collected in trials and in the general use on their products to fulfill regulations and detect new signals to keep their product labels up to date. While those actions have an indirect benefit for the patient, to truly help them and their healthcare practitioners it is necessary to go beyond the raw data and translate the information into the benefit to risk context, informing risk management plans and specific mitigation actions that are derived from data. The goal of pharmacovigilance should be to minimize pain and suffering in patients who strive to benefit from the medicine prescribed by their physician. By properly characterizing benefits and risks of medicines in appropriate populations and semi-quantitatively or quantitatively estimating whether and to which extent the benefits outweigh the risks one can create tangible context for regulators, prescribers, and patients. This informs specific action plans for the health care provider to optimize the use of the treatment ensuring the right medicine gets to right patient. We will present our experience on some specific examples derived directly from our joint experience in safety and pharmacovigilance.
