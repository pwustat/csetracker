**About the speakers & their talks:**    

**Mr Brennan Kahan (UCL)**  

Title/Abstract: Estimands in randomised trials: ensuring trials get the right answer to the right question  

The exact treatment effect being estimated in a randomised trial is often unclear, or in some cases, not relevant to clinical decision making. Estimands are a way of clarifying the treatment effect of interest, and can be used to (i) ensure the question being addressed is clear and clinically relevant; and (ii) ensure the trial is appropriately designed and analysed to answer the question of interest. In this talk I will describe the estimands framework, including: (a) what estimands are; (b) how investigators can choose appropriate estimands for their own trials; and (c) how estimands can be used to guide choices on trial design and analysis strategies.

Title/Abstract: ICH E9 estimands addendum: Old wine in new bottles or a genuine step forward?  

In this talk I will introduce the ICH E9(R1) estimand addendum and how it helps clarifying scientific objectives in clinical trials (https://www.ich.org/). Using real hematology trial examples I will discuss how the estimand framework helps to design trials with complex treatment options such as potential curative procedures or treatment sequence across different phases. If time permits I will also illustrate how the framework helped clarify whether and how clinical trials might need to be adapted in reaction to the Covid pandemic.  

**Prof Stijn Vansteelandt (LSHTM/Ghent University)**  

Title: Adopting the estimand framework: be greedy, but not too ambitious    

The ICH E9 addendum on estimands is timely and welcome in stimulating data analysts to target simple effect measures, directly linked to the scientific question of interest, as is now mainstream in causal inference.  

This focus is vastly different from that adopted in the statistical modelling tradition, which instead uses a statistical model (rather than an estimand) as the starting point of a statistical analysis.  

In the first part of the talk, I will argue that this focus on estimands has the potential to raise the quality of data analyses to another level. It therefore deserves to be more greedily adopted in all data analyses, including those that do not suffer complications due to intercurrent events. I will illustrate this by reconsidering the longstanding problem of whether and how to adjust for baseline covariates in randomised clinical trials.  

I will next caution for one major drawback of the estimand framework: that it enables researchers to target questions about which the data carry little or no information. In the second part of the talk, I will therefore caution for the use of overly ambitious estimands. I will illustrate this with a proposal on how to deal with complications due to rescue treatment in randomised clinical trials.
