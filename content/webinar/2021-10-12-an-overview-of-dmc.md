Clinical trials are experiments performed on human volunteers to evaluate a candidate intervention to a control. Randomizing participants to an intervention arm is the gold standard to causally assess the benefit-to-risk ratio.  While clinical trials require appropriate design considerations and pre-specification of analytic methods, interim monitoring of study recruitment, retention, safety, and efficacy are essential to preserve trial integrity.  To this end, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC, also referred to as a Data Safety Monitoring Board/Committee, DSMB/DSMC) typically comprised of 3-5 experts, including clinicians and a (bio)statistician, serves to safeguard trial participants, assess benefit-to-risk, and provide recommendations to the sponsor (e.g., pharmaceutical company or government institution) based on accumulating trial data.  Statisticians play critical roles on the DMC, the sponsor's study team, and as an independent statistician (receives and summarizes unblinded data for DMC review).
