Scientists realized soon after the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that airborne transmission, which is by inhalation of small airborne virus laden particles (often called aerosols), generated during human respiratory activities was the main mode of the spread of the infection. The prevailing theory of infection transmission, that it was via the direct contact with much bigger particles (often called droplets), leading to distancing at 6 feet arose from work by Flugge in 1897 and later theory by Well-Riley. Immediately upon the detection of the virus, Dr. Morawska and other aerosol experts recognized that the virus may be transmitted by much smaller particles than recognized by Flugge, over longer distances (as far as 60 feet and further) and lingering longer in the air. This is a major change in understanding and public health implications of virus transmission. WHO guidance was modified to reflect the possibility of virus transmission over longer distances and lingering longer in the air. It is expected that this will lead to changes in public health policy regarding mask usage, and ventilation of buildings and other areas people may gather.
