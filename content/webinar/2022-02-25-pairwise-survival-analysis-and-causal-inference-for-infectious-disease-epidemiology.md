**Presenter:** Eben Kenah  
**Abstract:**  
Pairwise survival analysis and causal inference for infectious disease epidemiology: Causal inference for infectious disease transmission is complicated because outcomes in different individuals are inherently dependent, which leads to interference or spillover of treatment effects. For example, individuals who are not vaccinated are partly protected when individuals around them are vaccinated. An established approach to this problem is to define causal effects in populations (e.g., a vaccination program in a village) and then attempt to measure these directly. An alternative approach is to define causal effects in pairs of individuals and estimate them using methods from pairwise survival analysis. This approach is likely to yield results that generalize more easily between populations, and it allows more detailed mechanistic insight into the effects of interventions. These pairwise causal effects can be used as the basis of epidemic models that allow estimation of the causal effect of an intervention in a population. This approach places greater emphasis on the longitudinal study of transmission in close contact groups than has been evident in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

**Abstract:**  
Understanding transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases from contact-tracing data: Contact-tracing data provide crucial and reliable information for understanding transmissibility, risk drivers and intervention efficacies for newly emerging infectious diseases. Analysis of such data is often challenging mainly due to surveillance bias, missing data and lack of biological understanding, which have been further exacerbated by COVID-19. We examine several of these challenges: (1) diagnostic bias towards symptomatic infections; (2) presymptomatic infectivity, i.e., the latent period is shorter than the incubation period; and (3) reporting bias, where only confirmed cases are reported but uninfected close contacts remain unknown. These issues, if left unaddressed, can lead to erroneous estimation of key epidemiological parameters. I will discuss our experiences in the analysis of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia several. I will introduce some statistical adjustments we have adopted to address the aforementioned challenges.
