The ICH E9(R1) Addendum on 'Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials' introduced a framework to align planning, design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. When defining the clinical question of interest, clarity is needed about 'intercurrent events' that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest, such as discontinuation of assigned treatment, use of an additional or alternative treatment and terminal events such as death. The description of an estimand should reflect the clinical question of interest in respect of these intercurrent events, and the Addendum introduces strategies to reflect different questions of interest that might be posed. The choice of strategies can influence how more conventional attributes of a trial are reflected when describing the clinical question, for example the treatments, population or the variable (endpoint) of interest.  

In this seminar we briefly introduce the estimand framework according to the ICH E9(R1) Addendum and describe various strategies for addressing intercurrent events when defining the clinical question of interest. We then reflect on the experience and lessons learned of implementing the Addendum through an internal cross-functional and cross-divisional working group that encompasses various estimand initiatives. Next, we discuss in detail the hypothetical estimand strategy, where a scenario is envisaged in which the intercurrent event would not occur. The Addendum acknowledges that a wide variety of hypothetical scenarios can be envisaged, but it also clarifies that some scenarios are likely to be of more clinical or regulatory interest than others. We share our experiences and try to provide some guidance on their use in clinical trial practice. Finally, we demonstrate how the estimand framework can usefully be applied to clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to address potential pandemic-related trial disruptions and embed them in the context of study objectives and design elements. We introduce different hypothetical estimand strategies and review various causal inference and missing data methods such as multiple imputation and (augmented) inverse probability weighting for the estimation step. To clarify, we describe the features of a stylized trial in neuroscience, and how it may have been impacted by the pandemic. This stylized trial will then be re-visited by discussing the changes to the estimand and the estimator to account for pandemic disruptions.
