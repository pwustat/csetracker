<!--more-->
Building on the previous webinar series we will present a refresher on the key elements of the estimand framework and use the ETHOS study to illustrate the estimand framework and to highlight the different options that may be of interest to different stakeholders. The background and disease context of the case will be described, the important events (termed intercurrent events) occurring in the trial will be described and three estimands will be showcased. It will then be explored how best to communicate the estimands in medical journals.
