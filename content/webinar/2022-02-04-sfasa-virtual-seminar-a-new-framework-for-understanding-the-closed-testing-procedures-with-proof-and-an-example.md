Closed testing procedures (CTPs) were originally proposed by Marcus, Peritz, and Gabriel (1976). CTPs were developed to provide a multiple testing framework that ensures strong control of the type 1 error rate. Many of the most common methods used when evaluating multiple endpoints in clinical trials (e.g., Holms, Hochberg, Hommel, graphical methods etc.) can be recast as CTPs. In this talk I attempt to make the closure principle more tangible by using a new algebra-based formulation of the closed testing framework. This approach attempts to ensure that each step in the derivations and proofs clearly follows from the previous steps. Through this approach, we build toward a better understanding of the versatility and usefulness of the foundational principle underlying all CTPs. We provide a framework for understanding how the closure principle controls the type 1 error rate and what we believe to be an accessible proof of how the closure principle strongly controls the family-wise error rate.
