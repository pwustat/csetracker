The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study has been tracking the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in England approximately monthly since May 2020 as Englandâ€™s first wave of infections declined.  

In this talk, Prof Christl Donnelly will discuss her work on REACT and the critical role community-based surveillance studies play in providing situational awareness and estimates of infection prevalence that are not biased by access to testing.
