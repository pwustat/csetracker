Git is the industry-standard platform for version control, and GitHub is the online platform for managing git projects. I will give a broad overview of the git application and GitHub platform, with specific applications illustrated with Rstudio. Following the book, "Happy git with R" by Jenny Bryan, I will show how to set up a GitHub account and connect it to Rstudio, create Rstudio projects that use git for version checking, and manage these projects using GitHub. I will demonstrate key verbs in the git language, including adding files to be committed, committing changes to files, and pushing changes into GitHub. I will also show elementary examples of collaboration with GitHub.
