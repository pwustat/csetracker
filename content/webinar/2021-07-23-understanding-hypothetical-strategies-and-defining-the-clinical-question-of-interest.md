More and more clinical trials have started adopting the estimand framework in protocols after the release of the ICH E9(R1) "Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials".  However, there is currently still a lack of clarity on the role of hypothetical strategies. The addendum recognizes that "when using the hypothetical strategy, some conditions are likely to be more acceptable for regulatory decision making than others". However, it is still unclear as to what constitutes "acceptable hypothetical conditions" which could lead to an interpretable treatment effect.  Therefore, it is of great interest to have a diverse group of experts take a deep dive into this topic and help shed light on considerations of hypothetical strategies relevant to the clinical question of interest.  In this webinar, we will have speakers from regulatory agencies and industry to share their perspectives on this interesting topic and also participate in a panel-discussion.
