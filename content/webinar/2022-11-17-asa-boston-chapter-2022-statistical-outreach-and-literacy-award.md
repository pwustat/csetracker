Science communication and storytelling with scientific data represent two distinct ways of constructing reality. There are traps when science and storytelling mean different things when they speak of truth. In our highly interconnected world, data scientists must promote knowledge sharing with broad audiences and develop effective tools for science communication. Working on complex problems related to health, climate change, humanitarian conflicts, pandemics, and environmental degradation, we recognize many challenges in data collection and analysis, modeling, data visualization, and results interpretation. Data science offers new opportunities for building narratives and storytelling. Making sense out of scientific data is my passion and way of critical thinking. In this talk I plan to illustrate how to overcome the hurdles of conveying the truth with scientific data and how we can use various forms of data visualization -- from multi-panel charts to dynamic maps -- to create data-driven narratives.
