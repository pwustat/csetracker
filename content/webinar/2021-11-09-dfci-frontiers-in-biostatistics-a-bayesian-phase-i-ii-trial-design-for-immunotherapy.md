Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that stimulates a patientâ€™s immune system to fight cancer. It demonstrates characteristics distinct from conventional chemotherapy and stands to revolutionize cancer treatment. We propose a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design that incorporates the unique features of immunotherapy by simultaneously considering three outcomes: immune response, toxicity and efficacy. The objective is to identify the biologically optimal dose, defined as the dose with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. An Emax model is utilized to describe the marginal distribution of the immune response. Conditional on the immune response, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a latent variable approach. Using the accumulating data, we adaptively randomize patients to experimental doses based on the continuously updated model estimates. A simulation study shows that our proposed design has good operating characteristics in terms of selecting the target dose and allocating patients to the target dose.
