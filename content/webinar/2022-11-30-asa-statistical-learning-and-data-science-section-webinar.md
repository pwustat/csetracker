Delphi's Epidata Project: Opportunities and Challenges in Auxiliary Surveillance for Public Health the United States

In 2015, the Delphi group (based out of Carnegie Mellon University) launched a system called Epidata, which was recently greatly expanded in 2020 in an effort to support the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic response. Epidata is a collection of data repositories, each of which contains signals to help track and forecast pathogens of concern to public health. A key feature of Epidata is that it leverages auxiliary data streams, which operate outside of traditional public health reporting. This talk will describe the directions we seek to take Epidata in the near future, numerous opportunities that we believe Epidata presents, as well as challenges therein.
