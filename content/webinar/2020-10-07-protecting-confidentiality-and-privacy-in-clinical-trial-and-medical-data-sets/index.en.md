We are increasingly living in a data driven world. Data are collected in many different ways for a variety of purposes. As such concerns around protecting the privacy of individuals have increased in recent times. Research into protecting the confidentiality of any data collected is an important and challenging area of research. In particular, there is often a trade-off between protecting confidentiality and preserving the utility in the data. This meeting seeks to explore and address issues of protecting confidentiality and privacy when it comes to collecting clinical trial and medical/health data. The session speakers comprise some of the world leaders and experts in the field bringing together researchers from both academia and the pharmaceutical industry.
