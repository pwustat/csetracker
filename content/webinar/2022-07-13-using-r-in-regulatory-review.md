We will invite three FDA staff sharing their experiences in using R in regulatory review. The session will start with Tae Hyun (Ryan) Jung sharing his experience in reviewing an R-based sNDA submission as a statistical reviewer. Following Ryanâ€™s presentation, Hyo Soo Cho will share her experience in reviewing the submission pilot 1 conducted by the R consortium R submission working group. The last section of
this event will be a panel discussion between Tae Hyun (Ryan) Jung, Hye Soo Cho and Paul Schuette.
The audience will also have the opportunity to ask questions through the live poll during the event.
