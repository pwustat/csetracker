In this webinar, we will explore some of the issues faced when statistical power is used as the sole metric for trial success when conducting a sample size determination.  

We will show how Bayesian assurance can be used as a complementary metric, that allows parameter uncertainty to be formally incorporated into the trial design.  

We also discuss some of the limitations of using a traditional confidence interval as the measure for success and examine Mixed Bayesian/Likelihood HPD interval and consensus-based approaches to interval construction as potential alternatives.
