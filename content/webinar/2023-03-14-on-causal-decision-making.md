Decision making is a fundamental aspect of human behavior. Effective decision making can lead to better outcomes, which requires an in-depth understanding of the causal relations between actions, environments, and outcomes. For example, a doctor needs to have a good understanding of the treatment effect in order to develop an effective treatment regime for the patients. In this talk, we will surface three essential components of decision making through a causal lens: 1. identifying causal relationships through causal structural learning; 2. understanding the effects of these relationships through causal effect learning, and 3. applying the above knowledge to inform decision-making through causal policy learning. Key ideas and methods will be discussed, accompanied by real-world examples to illustrate the application.
