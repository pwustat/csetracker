<span style="color: salmon;">*Duke-Margolis/FDA Virtual Workshop*</span>

<!--more-->
Real-world evidence (RWE) generated from real-world data (RWD) is increasingly being utilized to address scientific and regulatory questions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including both product safety and effectiveness. Evaluating RWE for regulatory use, however, depends on a robust causal inference framework, and there is growing stakeholder interest to understand how methodological advances with negative controls can improve causal inference.  

On March 8, 2023, the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, under cooperative agreement with the FDA, will convene a workshop on how negative controls could support new methodological approaches for causal inference in the Sentinel System. Discussion will inform the methods development projects aimed at: 1) establishing empirical methods to automate the negative controls identification in Sentinel and integrate it into the Sentinel Initiative tools, and 2) developing approaches to use a double-negative control adjustment to reduce unmeasured confounding in studying effectiveness of vaccines.
