Differentiating prognostic vs. predictive biomarkers impacts important decision makings for patients and treating physicians in precision medicine. Using hazard ratio (HR) can mistake a purely prognostic biomarker for a predictive one leading to a disheartening possibility of depriving patients of beneficial treatment as demonstrated in the OAK trial. This stems from the illogical issue of HR at population level where marginal HR in the overall population can be larger than those in both subgroups. The subgroup task force within the Oncology Estimand industry-wide working group discussed such issues and proposes the use alternative logic-respecting efficacy estimands such as ratio of medians, ratio and difference of restricted mean survival times and milestone probabilities. These measures are straightforward, easy to interpret and clinically meaningful. More importantly, they will lead to agreement between marginal and conditional efficacy estimates when analyzing real clinical trial data as long as logic-ensuring analysis principle such as Subgroup Mixable Estimation (SME) is followed. Detailed guidance is provided using either parametric or non-parametric approaches. Simultaneous inference can be provided with proper multiplicity adjustment to facilitate joint decision making with user-friendly apps.
