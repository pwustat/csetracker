The ICH E9 (R1) addendum on estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials is wellestablished in many pharmaceutical companies but there remain open questions. These workshops will focus on two prominent ICE strategies and discuss both conceptual issues and
novel statistical estimation approaches.  

Questions that will be discussed include:  

- How to implement a treatment policy strategy if data after intercurrent events (ICEs) are frequently missing?  

- When is a hypothetical strategy warranted and acceptable to regulators?  

- Is it mandatory to remove data after the ICE for implementing a hypothetical strategy?  

- How to estimate treatment effects for estimands with multiple intercurrent events and mixed estimand strategies?
