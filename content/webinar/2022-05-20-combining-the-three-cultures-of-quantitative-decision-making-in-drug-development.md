In this talk we shall argue that approaches to quantitative decision making can be divided into three areas or cultures: First, approaches based classical statistical thinking that aim to use the tools of statistical inference and experimental design to provide solutions with well understood operating characteristics. Second, those based on modeling to provide a good approximation and then potentially use simulation to propagate uncertainty around a target, leading to a basis for decision making. Finally, those based on machine learning that is often used to reduce complex high dimensional problems and provide the basis for prediction.  

We shall review problems in a drug development setting using a case-study from a psoriatic arthritis drug development program to illustrate the richness and complexity of data collected during clinical development. Next, we shall show how each of the cultures can provide excellent solutions to certain problems. However, with increased use of data from a variety of sources, there is often a need to combine these three cultures to bring an appropriate solution to a problem. To illustrate this, we shall look at a class of problems where two treatments or options need to be compared but a randomized experiment is not possible. We shall review solutions that combine machine learning, statistical inference and potentially modeling. In addition, we shall review the problem of identifying prognostic and predictive factors using the knockoff approach, which combines control of operating characteristics with realistically complex modeling.
