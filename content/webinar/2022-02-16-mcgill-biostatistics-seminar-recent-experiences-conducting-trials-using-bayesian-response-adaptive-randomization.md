I will discuss my experiences coordinating two recent clinical trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that used Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs, and present some methodological innovations to improve implementation and understand the potential benefit these designs offer. I will discuss the ACCESS trial (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03119571), which sought to compare the efficacy of two standards or care: direct admission to the cardiac catheter laboratory versus the ICU; and the ARREST trial (NCT03880565), which sought to evaluate the efficacy of in-transit ECMO-facilitated resuscitation versus standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation. My experiences with these trials motivated methodological research into alternative prior choices and randomization techniques that improve type I error control and reduce the risk of enrolling a substantial proportion of participants to an inferior treatment arm. Building upon this research, we proposed and investigated comparing a set of potential designs in terms of the expected number of failures among the cohort most acutely affected by the choice of design; namely, persons who would participate in the trial if it were open to enrollment at the time they become eligible. I plan to discuss the details and take-aways from this line of research
