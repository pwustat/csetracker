This talk discusses analysis of repeated measures for binary, ordered polytomous, continuous, and semi-continuous outcomes frequently seen in mental health research. The first part of the talk considers panel data with a small number of time points (5-10). A random effects two-part ordinal model is introduced for longitudinal analysis of treatment effects and random intercept cross-lagged modeling (RI-CLPM). The second part of the talk considers intensive longitudinal data with many time points (50-100). Two-level time series analysis (dynamic structural equation modeling; DSEM) is used for modeling of daily cycles by sine-cosine curves as well as two-part modeling of semi-continuous outcomes that have strong floor effects. Examples are drawn from a randomized trial of treatments of alcohol dependence, a study of suicidal ideation and substance abuse, and studies of negative affect and at-risk mood profiles related to depression in adolescents.
