In the current pandemic the need to translate clinical data into actionable research to inform patient care has never been more urgent. Using the Precision Medicine Analytics Platform at Johns Hopkins University, a team of clinicians, biostatisticians and information technologists at the Precision Medicine Center of Excellence for COVID-19 rapidly created a COVID-19 patient registry and deployed an array of biostatistical methods to understand patient trajectories, conduct comparative effectiveness research for therapeutics, learn about pathobiology of COVID-19 and implement a real-time prediction model into the electronic health record (EHR). Join this session to hear about the lessons learned from conducting research in real time while building a complex data registry.
