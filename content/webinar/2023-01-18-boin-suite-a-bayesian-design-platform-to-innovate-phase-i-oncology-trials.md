US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design the fit-for-purpose designation as a tool for drug development. This is the third design that received this prestigious designation over the last decade. In this talk, I will review the statistical principle of BOIN designs and how they provide an integrated platform to accommodate various types of phase I trials, including single-agent trials, drug-combination trials, trials with late-onset toxicity, and trials to find the optimal biological dose. Practical guidance and software, freely available at www.trialdesign.org, will be provided with real-world trial examples.
