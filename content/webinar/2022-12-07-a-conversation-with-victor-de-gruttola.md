Dr. DeGruttola's research activities have focused on addressing concerns of communities most affected by the HIV epidemic through development and application of statistical methods required for appropriate public health response. This work has led to novel research strategies for investigation of natural history, prevention and treatment of HIV infection and its consequences.  

Early in the epidemic, Dr. DeGruttola worked with Marcello Pagano on projections of AIDS incidence using data from the New York City Health Department. Succeeding founding Director Stephen Lagakos, Dr DeGruttola led the Statistical and Data Analysis Center for the Adult Project of the AIDS Clinical Trials group during the period in which highly active antiretroviral treatment was first introduced. A primary research focus was on development and analysis of appropriate marker-based endpoints that could be assessed more rapidly than clinical endpoints, but nonetheless provide reliable evidence for clinical benefit. More recently Dr. DeGruttola has focused on issues that arise in design, monitoring, and analysis of cluster randomized trials of HIV combination prevention programs; this work was motivated by his role in an HIV prevention trial in Botswana. Working with colleagues Ravi Goyal and Rui Wang, Dr. DeGruttola used simulation studies to investigate the properties of different study designs. This work led to development of novel network methods for incorporating uncertain information from a variety of sources in the creation of appropriate agent-based models. The same team is currently extending and applying such methods to aid in the investigation, within hosts, of HIV persistence during antiviral treatment and of HIV rebound following treatment discontinuation.
