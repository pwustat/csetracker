This talk discusses the history and characteristics of the R software. R began, 20-odd years ago, as the open source clone of the S software. So the story of R has to start with S and with its history. S came from the Statistics and Data Analysis Research group at AT&T Bell Labs. We'll see that the design goal of S, and so of R, is to support studies in what we'd now call data science. The principles resulting from this goal are still central to computing for data science.
