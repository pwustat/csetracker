The clinical development of new drugs is known to be risky, with overall historical success rates from phase 1 to approval of less than 20%. The most critical phase of clinical development is the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 trials, with historical success rates around 40%. In other words, of all drugs that enter clinical development, 4 in 5 fail to get approved, and half of the failures occur in phase 3. The purpose of this talk will be to investigate statistical explanations for such a large proportion of failures, including the overestimation of treatment effects in phase 2 trials, the “winner’s curse”, and misinterpretation of P-values. These ideas will be explored through an informal discussion between a statistician and the head of a clinical development program. Moreover, Bayesian concepts will be explained in a non-technical manner and will be shown to lead to more sensible decision-making through an attenuation of the overestimation of treatment effects, and the replacement of P-values by posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
-	Phase II trials are likely to overestimate the magnitude of treatment effects
-	P-values are frequently misinterpreted, which leads to a “replication crisis”
-	Bayesian methods can address both the overestimation of treatment effects and the misinterpretation of P-values
