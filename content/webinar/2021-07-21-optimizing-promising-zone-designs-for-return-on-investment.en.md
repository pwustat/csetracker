The Constraint Promising Zone (CPZ) design, a new innovation on the promising zone design. The CPZ is a design that is easy to implement, and easy for all stakeholders to understand and accept. It is based on the intuitively plausible notion that any additional investment of sample size at an interim analysis should be contingent on a minimal acceptable return on the investment, expressed in terms of guaranteed conditional power.
