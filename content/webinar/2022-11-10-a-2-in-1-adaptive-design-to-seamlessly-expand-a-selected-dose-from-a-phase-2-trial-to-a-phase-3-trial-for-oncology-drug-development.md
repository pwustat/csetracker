In oncology, dose-finding studies are largely performed only in Phase I clinical trials and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a dose initially developed for systemic chemotherapies, is by default selected for the Phase 3 confirmatory trial. With the advent of anti-cancer therapies such as molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies, a paradigm shift is underway from the use of conventional MTD approaches to
improved dose selection strategies for oncology programs. In response to this new challenge, new study designs are needed to optimize dose selection while still bringing life-changing new therapies to patients as soon as possible. We propose a 2-in-1 adaptive design starting with a Phase 2 trial with randomized evaluation of two doses and only select one dose to expand to a Phase 3 trial if efficacy evidence is observed
based on an interim evaluation. The low dose will be selected if both doses show promising efficacy unless the high dose demonstrates a more compelling treatment effect, and the study will be seamlessly expanded to a Phase 3 trial with the selected dose with patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion also used for the statistical inference in the Phase 3 portion. The overall Type I error can be controlled under a mild
assumption. Simulation studies are conducted to confirm the control of Type I error and to demonstrate the desirable operating characteristics of the proposed design.
