Predictive time series analytics forms a key capability in realizing the vision of trustworthy and performant AI systems in a wide range of application domains from autonomous driving to cloud-native computing systems. Time series data helps capture rich temporal phenomena such as anomalous data trends or faulty system behavior, yet is challenging to analyze due to its high volume and complexity. This talk will highlight some of these challenges with real-world examples and introduce a selection of novel data science tools and techniques for tackling them in practice.
