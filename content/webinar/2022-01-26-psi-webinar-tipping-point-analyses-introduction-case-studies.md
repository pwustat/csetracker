**1. Tipping point sensitivity analysis for time-to-event: a case study in belimumab**    

In this presentation I will illustrate one way of implementing a tipping point analysis (TPA) for a time-to-event endpoint to assess the robustness of results to the censoring-at-random assumption. The method is based on multiple imputation and it assumes the hazard rate post-censoring changes. A grid of values reflecting such changes is considered to vary the hazard rate post-censoring independently for each treatment arm. The (experimental, control) pairs of post-censoring hazard rate changes form the TPA scenarios. Within each of the TPA scenarios, participants who are censored are imputed a time to the event of interest and are administratively censored if the imputed time exceeds the length of the follow-up. Results are combined across imputed datasets using Rubin’s rules. Finally, the plausibility of the scenarios where the results tip is discussed.  
 
**2. Practical use of Tipping Point Analysis in regulatory submissions of clinical trials**  

The tipping point analysis (TPA) approach has gained popularity recently as an approach for performing the sensitivity analysis under the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption. This presentation will review why TPA gets popular in clinical trial submissions, its implementation for binary endpoints for time-independent imputation and time-dependent imputation, general procedure of TPA implementation for continuous endpoints, and Interpretation of TPA result based on clinical input. The presentation then shows six real examples of FDA statistical review of submitted NDA/BLAs (all in public domain) that use TPA as sensitivity analysis to illustrate the practical use of this method in real trials and important consideration points from the regulatory perspective.
