The current drug development model is confronted by major challenges including rising clinical trial costs, a tougher competitive landscape, and 
growing pressure from payers. Consequently, there is an increasing
awareness that drug development must be fundamentally updated to meet
these challenges.  

This seminar first addresses why transformation is needed from a pharma
development and from an investor perspective. It then discusses three areas 
of innovation where biostatisticians can play a major role. The seminar will 
conclude with a panel discussion with all speakers and members from 
pharma and regulatory authorities.
