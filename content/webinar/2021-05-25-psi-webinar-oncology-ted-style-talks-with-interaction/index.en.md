The objective of this PSI virtual meeting is to enable practical interaction among clinical statisticians actively working in oncology and those interested to work in this area. The simple format of this meeting specifically facilitates these interactions, by balancing equally time dedicated to a sequence of short, engaging talks covering a broad range of relevant topics and to Q&A. A breakout session halfway through the meeting will also enable casual interactions with the speakers and among meeting participants.
