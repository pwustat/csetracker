In cancer, extending survival has always been the end goal for novel therapies. However, with increasing advances in cancer treatment, demonstrating survival benefit within the context of a clinical trial is increasingly difficult. It can now take over a decade to show improvement to survival in certain indications, and in early lines of treatment, detecting the benefit of the drug of interest is confounded by patients moving on to subsequent therapies. In addition, survival data fails to capture the full range of outcomes that may matter to patients and physicians, including longer periods of disease remission or avoidance of side effects.

There is therefore an increasing urgency to determine how novel therapies should be assessed in the absence of survival data. Non-OS endpoints such as progression-free survival and minimal residual disease may provide an early prediction of survival and enable a more holistic assessment of a novel therapy, particularly when combined with patient reported outcomes. However, a lack of consensus over the value of non-OS endpoints, as well as concerns over their ability to translate into long term outcomes, are limiting the use of these endpoints in HTA decision-making.

In this webinar, representatives from different stakeholder groups (patients, physicians, health economists and industry) will discuss the value of increasing the use of non-OS endpoints in reimbursement decision-making to their stakeholder groups. Using the example of multiple myeloma, the speakers will discuss how and when non-OS endpoints should be used, to support a future in which assessments of novel therapies are more fit-for-purpose.   

Learning Objectives  

- Discuss the key challenges with relying on Overall Survival (OS) benefit in HTA assessments in certain oncology indications.  
- Understand the value of increasing the use of non-OS endpoints in reimbursement decision-making from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and health economists.  
- Propose actions that can support the greater acceptance of non-OS endpoints and PROs in oncology to help patients access potentially life-extending therapies or therapies with improved outcomes in the absence of mature OS data.
