Limited access to large-scale, high-quality, and multi-source data is one of the key obstacles to deploying modern machine learning models, which is partly due to the reluctance of information exchange out of privacy concerns. Recent studies have found that data privacy has the potential to grow into a gigantic industry, because of the increasing demand of data sharing, fast development of AI software and platforms, and the vast adoption of data-related regulations and policies. In this talk, we will provide a broad overview regarding the status quo of data privacy, and render more details in differential privacy, one of the state-of-the-art data protection techniques.
