In this webinar, our goal is to review different types of Bayesian and frequentist designs that may be used for expansion cohorts in phase 1 trials and in single-arm and randomized phase 2 trials in oncology.  

– We will start by reviewing the recent evolution and general trends in the design of early-phase trials to investigate the activity of targeted agents and immunotherapy.  
– We will then summarize the most salient features of Bayesian and frequentist designs in this setting.  
– Finally, we will cover different statistical caveats, including early consideration of randomization, issues related to sample-size calculation and the efficient use of biomarkers.
