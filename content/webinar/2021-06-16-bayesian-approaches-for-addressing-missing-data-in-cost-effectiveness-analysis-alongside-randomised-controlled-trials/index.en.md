Health economics has become an increasingly important discipline in medical research. Bodies such as NICE provide guidance based on health economic evaluation. Much of recent research has focused on using advanced statistical decision theoretic approaches in health economic evaluation studies where the interest is in the analysis of a multivariate outcome comprising of clinical benefit and associated costs. Missing data on one or both outcomes is common in these studies. The complex structure of the relationships between the outcomes makes handling missing data more challenging in these studies. In this talk the issues related to missing data in health economic evaluation studies will be discussed and novel statistical models developed to handle missing data using a full Bayesian approach will be described, using as motivating example a pilot study conducted at UCL.
