Monte Carlo algorithms have completely revolutionised statistical computation, allowing previously intractable models to be solved easily. In particular, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have facilitated the application of Bayesian inference in a multitude of settings. One reason for their success is their strong theoretical foundations, which allow us to validate the basic algorithms, provide numerous extensions and generalisations, clarify different options and tunings, and evaluate the results. This talk will present some simple dynamic graphical examples to illustrate the workings of MCMC. It will emphasise the impact and importance of various theoretical MCMC issues including ergodicity, qualitative and quantitative convergence rates, optimal scalings, and adaptive MCMC. It will not assume any previous MCMC background, and is designed to be accessible to everyone.
