Innovations in imaging modalities and advancements of imaging technologies have improved our ability to diagnose, monitor or treat medical conditions. Recently, automatic registration, segmentation, visualization, classification and quantification of biomarkers have transformed the way we utilise medical images. In this session our speakers will discuss current methodologies and software development in this exciting area.
