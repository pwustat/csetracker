Recently, new FIRRMA final regulations have been published to further clarify the definition of “sensitive personal data” which was previously left to be developed by CFIUS. The final regulations clarify the provision on genetic testing in two ways: 1) by focusing the definition on genetic tests and 2) by limiting the coverage of the rule to identifiable data. The final regulations implement CFIUS’s jurisdiction over 11 specific categories of sensitive personal data, including health, biometric, and genetic data. CFIUS now have expanded jurisdiction over U.S. companies that collect or maintain records relating to a U.S. citizen's genetic information, such as a genetic test or individual or family history, which biotechnology or life sciences companies might collect and could lead to CFIUS review. CFIUS will closely monitor biotechnology and life sciences companies that operate in these relevant sectors and identify transactions in which a foreign investment raises a national security concern.
