Covariate balance is one of the most important concerns for successful comparative
studies (about causal effects), such as causal inference, online A/B testing and clinical
trials. However, chance imbalance may still exist in traditional randomized experiments,
and are substantial increasing in big data. In this talk, we discuss several new adaptive
designs and their advantages. The proposed methods show substantial advantages over
the traditional methods in terms of the covariate balance and computational time.  


Since the randomization inevitably uses the covariate information when forming balanced
treatment assignments, the validity of classical statistical inference following such
randomization is often unclear in literature. We derived the theoretical properties of
statistical inference post general covariate-adjusted randomization under the linear model
framework. More important, we explicitly unveil the relationship between covariateadjusted designs and inference properties. We apply the proposed general theory to
commonly used procedures and compare their performance analytically. These results
open a new door to understand and analyze comparative studies based on covariateadjusted randomization.
