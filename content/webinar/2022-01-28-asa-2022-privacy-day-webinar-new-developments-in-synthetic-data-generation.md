Synthetic data methods are used to generate microdata that protect confidentiality of the data units by replacing observed values with simulated ones. For this webinar, we bring together researchers currently working on novel synthetic data methods and applications in different areas including clinical data and official statistics. These talks will provide a glimpse of just a few ways in which synthetic data can be leveraged to increase public access to information from sensitive data.
