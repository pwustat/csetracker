Interpretation of a result of a primary endpoint in a clinical trial is made by reference to a single prespecified method of analysis. The convention of relying on a single method is risky as it may be suboptimal. Because we are blinded when we pre-specify, the risk that inference may depend on having selected an inferior method is always present. A better, robust, and versatile approach is to interpret the result by reference to an alpha-adjusted combined result derived from multiple prespecified methods. It is better because it has the potential to give more power than any single method. It is robust because given two methods, one optimal and the other suboptimal, the combined result is closer to the result from the optimal method. It is versatile because
for group sequential trials, the combined approach permits use of different methods at different times. The concept is akin to diversifying financial investments to minimize risk. A limitation of combining methods is that it does not produce an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.
It has applications in complex clinical trials because of the greater uncertainty in the performance of a single method. Application of this method to different types of examples attests to its potential for increased power, robustness, and versatility.
