The Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) subteam of the DIA-ASA Interdisciplinary Safety Evaluation (DAISE) scientific working group is an interdisciplinary effort that seeks to provide a clinical safety workflow for monitoring during clinical development in an open-source model. The working group utilizes a collaborative model where Statisticians and Clinical Professionals work together to develop innovative interactive graphics for safety monitoring. Our work is all free, publicly available, and easily accessible online and includes the interactive hepatic explorer and the safetyGraphics R package. In this webinar, we will demonstrate several of these tools with a focus on the benefits brought about by our cross-functional collaboration.
