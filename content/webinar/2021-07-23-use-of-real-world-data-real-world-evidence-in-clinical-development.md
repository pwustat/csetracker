*Part of the Fifth Boston Pharmaceutical Symposium*
<!--more-->
In recent years, the rapid increase in the volume, variety, and accessibility of digitized RWD and RWE has presented unprecedented opportunities for the use of RWD and RWE throughout the drug product lifecycle. We believe RWD and RWE will be leading the statistical innovation in healthcare industry and regulatory decision making for the next decades. In clinical development, RWD and RWE have the potential to improve the planning and execution of clinical trials and create a virtual control arm for a single arm for accelerated approval and label expansion. From the product lifecycle perspective, effective insights gleaned from RWE bring about informative relative benefits of drugs, comparative effectiveness, price optimization, and new indications.  Aiming to present a wide range of RWE applications throughout the lifecycle of drug product development, we have written a book "Real-World Evidence in Drug Development and Evaluation" which was published in February 2021. At the 2021 Boston Pharma Symposium, we are excited to share with researchers Chapter 4 â€“ External Control Using RWE and Historical Data in Clinical Development. This seminar will discuss the recent case studies that adopted RWD and RWE in the clinical development and evaluation from the following perspectives:  

- Utilize synthetic control to support single arm study  

- Utilize natural history study for rare disease development  

- Utilize RWD/historical data for label expansion  

- Practical considerations of using RWD/historical data in the clinical development
