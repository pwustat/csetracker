Interpretable/explainable Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging field to address the black-box nature of complex models obtained by many popular ML methods. Its success can remove one of the major obstacles that prevent ML from having more impact on areas such as healthcare, where human understanding of how a data-driven model works is crucial for many reasons. As many research fields have experienced in their infancy, few widely accepted notions and boundaries have given researchers the freedom to formulate this field with their visions, and to define the key concepts, such as interpretability and explainability, in their own ways. In this meetup, two leading researchers will share their efforts, contributions, and visions about this rapidly developing field.
