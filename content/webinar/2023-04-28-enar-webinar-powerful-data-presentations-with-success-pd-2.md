The amount of available data has exploded in the past ten years. Those holding quantitative roles in academia, government, and industry have been called upon to analyze and interpret it. We must turn data into information so that researchers can advance science and decision makers can act upon these advances. This is true whether you are assessing the performance of a new therapy, the impact of public health policy, or modeling disease transmission. It is also true for those presenting new statistical analysis methods. The point of a presentation is to synthesize facts in a meaningful, digestible way for the audience. Yet, many presentations serve to create confusion and because they lack clarity. Even worse, the lack of clarity leads to poor decisions built on erroneous interpretations.

Developing good communication skills around scientific and statistical presentations is essential for those in quantitative fields. This talk will discuss a four phased process for excelling at these types of presentations. The four phases are Prepare, Design, Practice and Deliver or (PD)2 for short. In the context of the process, emphasis will be placed on explaining complex concepts, formatting your results for clarity, designing your slides to facilitate interpretation, and engaging a non-quantitative or mixed level audience. The material will also cover incorporating story into a scientific presentation and effective principles of data visualization. You will leave the talk with an overall framework for tackling your next formal presentation as well as tips and tricks you can immediately use in informal team interactions.
