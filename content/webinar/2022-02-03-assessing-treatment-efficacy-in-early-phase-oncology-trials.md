In this webinar, we will:  

– Present a historical overview of efficacy assessment in early-phase trials  
– Highlight some recent regulatory trends in that respect  
– Discuss the tension between the clinically appealing and statistically sound methods to assess the efficacy of novel treatments in phase 1 trials, single-arm phase 2 trials, and randomized phase 2 trials
