At Shopify, we have over 1.7 million merchants across over 175 countries, with hundreds of millions of consumers shopping at their stores. We’re focused on leveraging the scale of our data to not only empower Shopify, but to create new experiences for our merchants that are impossible without data. In our daily operations at Shopify, we are highly data informed. Some of the ways we’re leveraging advanced analytics is by building an anomaly detection engine that allows us to process over hundreds of thousands of metric/segment combinations in a very accessible way. In her talk, Dr. Hilal will share key tips on how you can apply machine learning for anomaly detection and forecasting at scale.
