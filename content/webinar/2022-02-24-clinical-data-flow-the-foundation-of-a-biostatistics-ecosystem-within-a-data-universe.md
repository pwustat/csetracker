**Event overview:**    

The key to making sense of the clinical data universe with so many disparate sources of data available in so many different formats is to create a standards-based data ecosystem.  Making true impact involves building integrated data flow through the ecosystem to support automation and data-driven standardized processes.   

**3 Key take-aways**   

- Understand how data flow is an integral part of transformative biostatistics technologies and processes.   

- See how clinical data and metadata repositories are married with data flow philosophies to create a biostatistics ecosystem.   

- Realize how an overlay of standardization and automation on top of the biostatistics ecosystem maximizes end to end efficiencies and first pass quality improvements.
