An objective of randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines is to develop evidence for whether and how antibody biomarkers can be appropriately used as surrogate endpoints for accelerating approval and increasing distribution of effective vaccines. I will summarize the COVID-19 Prevention Trial Networkâ€™s harmonized statistical analysis plan for generating this evidence based on the analysis of several phase 3 trials. The statistical methods include causal inference methods within the principal stratification, controlled effects, stochastic interventional effects, and mediation frameworks. The webinar seeks to describe the distinct contributions of the different methods and a strategy for synthesizing the set of results. The webinar also considers how the analyses can account for the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which may impact vaccine efficacy.
