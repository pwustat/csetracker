For many medical devices requiring surgical implantation, large scale randomized, controlled, double-blind studies cannot be conducted due to multiple practical limitations. In addition, device development, as opposed to drug development, often occurs in an iterative manner with subsequent device generations being modified to a minor to moderate extent. Therefore, it is not surprising that many flexible study designs to leverage existing data (external to the current pivotal study) via innovative application of statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian, propensity score) have been adopted in the medical device area. In this talk, within the context of the recent FDA breakthrough program to ensure that patients with high unmet medical need (e.g., Heart Failures) have more timely access to innovative medical devices by expediting their development, we will share our experience in the need for seamless clinical trial design with the possibility to leverage a relevant external existing dataset via an improved dynamic borrowing method by taking clinical reasoning into account via equivalence margin-driven similarity measure to ensure any external data borrowing occurs only when the difference between the current and prior means falls within a pre-specified narrow margin.
