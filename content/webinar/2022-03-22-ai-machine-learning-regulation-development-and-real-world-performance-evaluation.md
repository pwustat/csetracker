The Duke-Margolis Center of Health Policy, together with the support from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) speakers and panelists, will hold a public webinar to spotlight updates and progress made since the release of FDA CDRH’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan on January 12, 2021.  

There will be a fireside chat between Jeff Shuren, FDA’s director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CRDH), and Mark McClellan, director of Duke-Margolis, followed by three panel discussions focused on the following topics:  

- overarching frameworks for regulating and evaluating AI  
- good machine learning practices (GMLP)  
- post-market evaluation of AI/ML SaMD   

The webinar will end with a business roundtable discussion on how developers and health care systems are considering these issues.
