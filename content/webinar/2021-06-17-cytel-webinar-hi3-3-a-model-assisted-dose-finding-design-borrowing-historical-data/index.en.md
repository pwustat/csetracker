Yuan Ji will discuss his recent publication, Hi3+3: A Model-Assisted Dose-Finding Design Borrowing Historical Data, in the webinar presentation. The purpose of the publication was based on a hybrid design that partly uses probability models and partly uses algorithmic rules for decision making. The aim is to improve the efficiency of the dose-finding trials in the presence of historical data, maintain safety for patients, and achieve a level of simplicity for practical applications.
