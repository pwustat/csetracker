The webinar aims to provide information on the purpose and methods for covariate adjustment in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The speakers will review and compare different approaches for adjusting for covariates in terms of the properties of the statistics, estimands, convergence and handling of missing data. The FDA's revised guidance on adjusting for covariates in RCTs and relevant commentary will be discussed with the objective to provide practical examples for analysis planning in studies. The speakers will offer insights into issues such as collapsibility, marginal and conditional effects and provide examples on how to use covariates to describe effects.
