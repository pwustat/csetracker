Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) will act as the single entry point for clinical trials authorisation and supervision in the EEA. CTIS was created as part of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014).  

This EMA hosted webinar is open to all sponsor organisations, including pharmaceutical companies, contract research organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and academic organisations.  

Topics presented during the webinar include how sponsor organisations can prepare for CTIS, how Member States aim to support sponsor preparedness and adoption of CTIS, the role of the Clinical Trial Regulation and how sponsors can best make use of EMAâ€™s CTIS training materials.
