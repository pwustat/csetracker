<!--more-->
The event was designed to be of interest to a wide audience. Pursuant to the EU’s regulatory approach, companies that adhere to harmonised standards enjoy a legal presumption of conformity with the regulatory requirements to which the standards relate. As a result, the standards developed by CEN-CENELEC JTC 21 are set to play an influential role as AI governance tools within the EU and beyond. They will be relevant to any AI developers seeking to do business in the EU, but will also play an important role in discussions on best practices and regulatory interoperability for AI at the wider international level.
