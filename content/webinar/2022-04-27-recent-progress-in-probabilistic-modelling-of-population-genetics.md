From branching processes to the Ewens sampling formula, it is remarkable how models originally from population genetics have also featured prominently in other areas of probability. The aim of this workshop is to present some recent progress in the probabilistic modelling of population genetics as well as various interactions with other areas. Three experts will talk about their recent works. There will also be opportunities for discussion with them.
