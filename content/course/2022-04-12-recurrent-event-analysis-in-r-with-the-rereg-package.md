Each hour a different part:  

- Prepare recurrent event data in R with the Recur() function.  
- Exploring recurrent event data with event plots and mean cumulative function with the plotEvent() and mcf() functions.  
- Simulating recurrent event data and fitting regression models with the simSC() and reReg()functions.
