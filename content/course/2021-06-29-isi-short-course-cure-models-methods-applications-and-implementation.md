This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to cure models, including basics of the cure models as well as many recent developments related to the methodological issues and software implementations of cure models for right-censored time-to-event data subject to non-informative censoring. The course will feature real-world examples from clinical trials and population-based studies and a detailed introduction to R packages, SAS macros, and WinBUGS programs to fit some cure models. Applications of cure models in other disciplines will be discussed. This course will be useful for statistical researchers and graduate students, and practitioners in other disciplines to have a thorough review of modern cure model methodology and to seek appropriate cure models in applications.
