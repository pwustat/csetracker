This short course will provide an overview of using R and Python for some of the most popular machine learning and deep learning models in real-world data science applications in the cloud environment. The sessions will step through the basic theoretical concepts behind those models and mainly focus on applications. Students will learn the motivation and use cases of these models through hands-on exercises.   

The main topics of the course include: big data cloud environment, tree-based models, regularization methods, feedforward neural network, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network.  

The course syllabus, program, and materials are available on the website https://course2021.scientistcafe.com/.
