<!--more-->
There is tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the application of Machine 
learning (ML) in drug development. ML tools can process information much faster, cheaper 
and more accurately than any human, and some people expect no less than a change to 
the clinical drug development paradigm.  
In this seminar, the participants will get up to speed with the opportunities of ML in drug 
development. The statistical details behind the ideas, the implementation using software 
(R) as well as the interpretation of the results will be discussed. Any examples will be 
inspired by real problems.  
Markus Lange and Lorenz Uhlmann (both Novartis) will provide an overview of machine 
learning and artificial intelligence and its application in the pharmaceutical industry. They 
will illustrate key elements and principles for building and assessing machine learning 
methods, discuss different types of algorithms (e.g. supervised and unsupervised learning) 
and provide examples of the types of problems where they might be applied.
