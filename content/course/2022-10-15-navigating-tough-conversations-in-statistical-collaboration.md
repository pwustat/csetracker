Statistical practitioners face difficult conversations in their interactions with their clients and collaborators. The topics of these conversations vary widely, from completion timelines to the use and interpretation of p-values. While there are no universal guidelines for navigating tough conversations, thoughtful discussion about common experiences and lessons learned; reflection on differences among individuals and situations; and exercises such as role playing can be helpful to prepare and build confidence for engaging in future tough conversations. In this course, we will build participants’ confidence to effectively communicate with clients and customers when challenging topics or situations arise.  

**In this course, we will:**  

- Give and solicit examples of difficult conversations often encountered in statistical collaboration.  

- Provide suggestions to approach and engage in these difficult conversations through multiple interactive activities, with a focus on leveraging participant strengths by using individual personality and skills to have these conversations in participants’ own style.

- Engage participants in the interactive session and learn from each other through discussion, role-playing, and conversations motivated by participants’ questions and recently produced videos portraying several difficult conversations between statisticians and their collaborators.  

**Course learning objectives**

- Build confidence for engaging in difficult conversations by improving skills for navigating these conversations, while respecting individual differences in communication strategies and professional settings and relationships    

- Cultivate communication skills and strategies for having difficult conversations on both technical and professional topics with collaborators and clients 

- Reflect on participant strategies for communication in the context of their career and their job’s expectations  
- Create a sense of community among participants and start to build a support network for continued discussion and reflection after the course.
