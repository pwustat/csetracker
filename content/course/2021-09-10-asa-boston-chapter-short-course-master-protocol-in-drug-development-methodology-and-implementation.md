The scientific communities are in great need to develop innovative trial designs that can incorporate multiple treatments and/or multiple diseases. Such designs provide results for multiple complex hypotheses of clinical interest and reduce the cost and timeline of development. There has been increasing interest in adopting master protocols to expedite clinical development programs. Master protocol have the potential to drive tremendous efficiencies in the development of new therapeutics or vaccines. These trials, in general, are more efficient and less costly than to perform trials individually. These efficiencies can be operational and/or statistical in nature. The master protocol is defined as one overarching protocol that would answer multiple questions or hypotheses. It includes a wide variety of designs with one potential treatment and different disease/population (basket design), multiple potential treatment and one disease (umbrella design), and multiple potential treatment along with multiple disease/population (platform design). In addition, master protocols are adaptive to include early stopping for efficacy or futility, sample size adjustment, dropping an arm, changing randomization ratio, and introducing a new treatment arm during trial. Further statistical efficiency can be gained by use of a shared control. In rare or difficult to enroll populations, a master protocol offers the opportunity to steer important new therapies into a standing clinical trials infrastructure, potentially expediting the availability of badly needed new therapies.  

The short course will provide an overview of the master protocol along with statistical and operational aspects. This will cover methodology, general design framework and strategies, sample size calculation, and necessary steps for protocol implementation. In addition, we will share through case studies on practical points to consider when running master protocols.  

**Outline**

- Statistical considerations  
- Operational considerations  
- Practical implementation: study protocol, DSMB
