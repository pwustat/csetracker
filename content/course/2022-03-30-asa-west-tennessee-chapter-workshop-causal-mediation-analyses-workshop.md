**Agenda:**  
- 	Introduction to session  
-   Introduction to non-counterfactual mediation methods. Introduce the concepts of total, direct and indirect effects. Briefly introduce counterfactual theory, but direct to further reading (MR mediation methods are not based on counterfactual reasoning)  
-   Introduce the basic principles of MR, including one and two-sample analyses, data harmonisation, effects estimated  
-   Introduce two-step/network MR and MVMR  
-   Computer practical working through an MR example, to estimate a total effect, then conduct MR mediation analyses to decompose a direct and indirect effect
