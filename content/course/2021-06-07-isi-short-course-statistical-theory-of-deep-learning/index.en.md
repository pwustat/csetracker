**Course outline**  
1. Motivation: The present great success of Deep Learning  
2. Statistical learning theory: Regression and Classification  
3. The theory behind Deep Learning:  
a. Introduction of Neural Networks  
b. Different network architectures and activation functions  
c. Approximation theory: Which function classes can be efficiently   approximated by DNNs?  
d. Generalization: Convergence rates of DNNs for different regression and classification problems. When are those networks able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality?  
4. Limits and open questions of DNNs
