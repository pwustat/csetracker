The training will provide intermediate to advanced learners with a solid data science foundation to address challenges related to collecting, managing, processing, interrogating, analyzing and interpreting complex health and biomedical datasets using R. Participants will gain skills and acquire a tool-chest of methods, software tools, and protocols that can be applied to a broad spectrum of Big Data problems.  

Before diving into the mathematical algorithms, statistical computing methods, software tools, and health analytics, we will discuss a number of driving motivational problems. These will ground all the subsequent scientific discussions, data modeling, and computational approaches. The training will involve active-learning and integrate driving motivational challenges with mathematical foundations, computational statistics, and modern scientific inference.  

Building on open-science principles, training will focus on effective, reliable, reproducible, and transformative data-driven discovery. Trainees will develop scientific intuition, computational skills, and data-wrangling abilities to tackle Big biomedical and advanced health data problems. The instructor will provide well-documented R-scripts and software recipes implementing atomic data-filters, as well as complex end-to-end predictive big data analytics solutions.
