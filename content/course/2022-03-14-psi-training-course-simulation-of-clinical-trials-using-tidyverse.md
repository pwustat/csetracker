In this course, we introduce a framework for clinical trial simulations that makes extensive use of the tidyverse collection of R packages. The course is punctuated with real-world case studies that demonstrate the versatility of the framework, and the relative ease with which it can be applied in practice. The case studies will cover:
- Assurance  
- Go/No-go decisions  
- Power comparisons  
- Count, binary and time to event endpoints  
- Censored data  
- Recurrent events
