This course will provide a gentle introduction to Bayesian methods for those with a limited understanding of Bayesian statistical concepts or for those who want a refresher and more practical experience. The course will introduce basic elements of Bayesian inference and provide a “hands-on” workshop performing familiar statistical tests and models using OpenBUGS software.
