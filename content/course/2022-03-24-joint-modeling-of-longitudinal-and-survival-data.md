The following topics will be covered:

- Review of Relative Risk and Mixed Models: Definitions, Cox and linear mixed models, how to fit them in R  

- The Basic Joint Model: Definition of joint models, assumptions, estimation, comparison with time-dependent Cox model, connection with missing data  

- Extensions of the Basic Joint Model: Functional form, Multiple longitudinal outcomes, multiple failure times  

- Special topics: Dynamic predictions for the survival and longitudinal outcomes
