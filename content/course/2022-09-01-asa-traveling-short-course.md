**Description:**  

Second-generation p-values were recently proposed to address the well-known imperfections of classical p-values. Their implementation can largely be thought of as codifying ‘good standard practice’ for interpreting and reporting classical p-values. Second-generation p-values maintain the favorable properties of classical p-values while emphasizing scientific relevance to expand their utility, functionality, and applicability. In particular, they can report evidence in favor of the alternative, in favor of the null hypothesis, or neither (inconclusive); they automatically incorporate an adjustment for multiple comparisons and multiple looks; they have lower false discovery rates than classical p-values; and they are easier to interpret. Second-generation p-values have been shown to work well in regularized models. They also lead to significantly improved model selection procedures in linear and generalized linear models. Also, second-generation p-values are non-denominational in the sense that they are readily applied in frequentist, likelihood and Bayesian settings.

**Outline and Objectives:**  

This course will briefly revisit the history of p-values as originally envisioned in significance and hypothesis testing, and the resulting controversy over their scientific interpretation. The importance of distinguishing between three key inferential quantities (the measure of the strength of evidence, design error rates, and false discovery rates for observed data) will be illustrated. The second-generation p-value will be introduced and contrasted with standard methods. The workshop will explain how to design studies in which the second-generation p-value is used as the primary mode of inference. We will cover computation of second-generation p-values (in R), guidelines for presenting results, and when appropriate, how to present accompanying false discovery rates. Multiple examples will be presented using data from clinical trials, observations studies and high-dimensional analysis of large-scale data. Advanced applications in model selection, adaptive monitoring of clinical trials, and regularized models will be shown if time allows. Mathematical details will be kept to a minimum, e.g., statistical properties will be presented but without mathematical proof.
