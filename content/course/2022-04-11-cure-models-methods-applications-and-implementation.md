This course will cover the following topics:  

- Basics of parametric mixture and non-mixture cure models, the EM-based estimation methods, model assessment methods, some existing R packages, and SAS macros for parametric cure models, analysis of real-world data sets.   

- Basics of the semiparametric and nonparametric mixture and non-mixture cure models, the estimation methods, and existing R packages and SAS macros illustrated with real-world data sets.  

- Cure models for multivariate, recurrent-event, and competing-risks survival data based on both marginal and random-effects (frailty) approaches.
Joint models of longitudinal and survival data with a cure fraction for clinical trial data analyses.  

- Statistical testing for the existence and difference of cure rates and also the identifiability and sufficient follow-up issues in cure model estimation.
New developments in Bayesian methods for cure models and general implementations of Bayesian analysis using BUGS program.  

- Applications of cure models in the population-based cancer survival analysis.
Statistical issues in the design and analysis of cancer clinical trials with a possible cure fraction and R programs of a suite of tools for applied researchers in clinical trials.
