      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use of open access software, especially R,  is becoming prevalent in pharma. There is a tremendous amount of interest, but many do not understand the basic landscape regarding regulatorsâ€™ thoughts, the groups that have been working in this area and what has already been accomplished.  This meet-up will discuss this topic from different viewpoints, including an expert from the R Validation Hub (the group that has probably given the deepest thought to this topic), regulatory, and practitioners who have used open access software for submissions in the device field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
