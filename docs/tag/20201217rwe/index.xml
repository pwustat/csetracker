      <description>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has disrupted the evidence-generation paradigm, resulting in the expanded use of novel technologies, data, and evidence. These new advancements not only improve clinical care and medical product development to fight the pandemic, but also have the potential to inform the future of drug development more broadly. This meeting will explore how COVID-19 has accelerated decision-maker understanding and use of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) and its application in a post-COVID-19 environment.&lt;/p&gt;
